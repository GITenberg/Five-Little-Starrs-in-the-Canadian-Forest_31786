<h2>FIVE LITTLE STARRS IN<br />A CANADIAN FOREST</h2>



<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>A LUMBER CAMP IN PROSPECT</h3>


<div class='cap'>"DADDUM, are we 'most
there?" asked Dorothy
Starr, impatiently, as the uncomfortable
local train creaked over its
uneven tracks through dense forests
in Western Ontario.</div>

<p>"Almost, Dot&mdash;have a little more
patience and soon you will be able
to exercise those active little legs,"
returned Mr. Starr, as he consulted
his watch.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>"Guess we'll all be glad to exercise
after this awful smoky, crampy
ride," grumbled Donald, Dot's twin
brother.</p>

<p>"Our winter in the lumber camp
will have to be mighty fine to make
us forget this outlandish trip ever
since we left Grand Forks," declared
Meredith Starr, the oldest
boy.</p>

<p>"We have one consolation, Mete,
and that is, we don't have to travel
home in the Spring by the same
route," laughed his sister Lavinia.</p>

<p>"Well, children, you all have had
some remark to make about the discomforts
of this car and the dreadful
condition of the tracks, but it is far
better than riding in a springless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
lumber wagon for the same <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'disstance'">distance</ins>,"
commented Mrs. Starr,
shifting the baby's sleepy head from
her shoulder to her knees.</p>

<p>"We'd never have come if Daddum
knew we had to travel <i>that</i>
way!" exclaimed Don.</p>

<p>"No, but Daddum had to travel
that way, and on horseback, years
ago, before this track was laid," replied
Mrs. Starr.</p>

<p>"Did you, Daddum? Oh, do tell
us about it!" cried the restless children,
as they crowded into the seat
beside their father.</p>

<p>"It isn't an exciting tale, but it is
very appropriate at this time," replied
Mr. Starr, smiling at the eager
faces. "I was a very young man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
then. I didn't find out until I returned
to New York after that trip
what a prize your mother was."</p>

<p>"Oh, how does Mumzie know
about the trip, then?" asked Dot.</p>

<p>"Because I have often told her
how that trip decided for me my future
business life," replied Mr.
Starr.</p>

<p>"Dot, please don't interrupt Daddum
with silly questions again,"
said Lavinia to her little sister.</p>

<p>"When I got off the train at
Grand Forks, on that trip, I expected
to meet an old <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'freind'">friend</ins> at the station,
but he was not there. I
stopped at the best hotel in the town,
which would have been about sixth-rate
anywhere else, and the next<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
morning my friend Dean came in.
He had had to ride about forty miles
out of his way on account of a
flooded river and that was why he
was not on time to meet me.</p>

<p>"Well, after he had made a few
purchases in town he was ready to
start back. I had a good horse waiting
for me at the hotel shed, and
soon we were on the return trip.</p>

<p>"The further north we went the
more beautiful and wilder the scenery
became until I thought we would
be lost in the dense primeval forests.
How Dean managed to find his way
I could not make out, but he seemed
to know every stump, every mound,
and every blaze on the trees along
the trail.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>"We stopped at noon to rest the
horses and have a bite to eat. While
we lay under the trees smoking our
pipes and waiting for the horses to
finish their oats, an old hunter
passed by.</p>

<p>"We invited him to join us but
he was anxious to meet an Indian
trapper some miles further on, so
we were compelled to decline Dean's
invitation.</p>

<p>"After finishing our pipes, we
started on the last half of our journey.</p>

<p>"We hadn't gone more than four
miles before we saw in the trail the
deep cut of a wagon-track that
struck in from a side-trail that led to
an eastern lumber-town.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Huh! Must be pretty heavy
pulling for the horses,' said Dean,
knowing that it would take a heavy
load to make the wheels sink down
so far in the soft soil.</p>

<p>"'Were they here yesterday,
when you came by?' I asked.</p>

<p>"'No, and I should say the outfit
wasn't very far ahead, either,' replied
Dean.</p>

<p>"And so it was. In a short time
we caught up with a kind of 'prairie-schooner'
wagon, and found that
a pioneer with his family had dared
the wilderness of the Canadian forest
to wrest a living from the earth.</p>

<p>"Dean rode alongside for a time,
giving the man some valuable points
about the country, and advising him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
as to the best trails. The man
thanked us profusely as we rode on.</p>

<p>"While Dean talked with the man
I rode by the side of the wagon and
spoke with the wife who was a very
sweet woman of about thirty. She
held a child about two years old in
her lap while a boy of five slept upon
a bundle of clothing on the rough
wagon-floor.</p>

<p>"Now, this family had come from
a town eighty miles east of the trail
where we met them, and they were
bound for a distant, fertile valley
about a hundred miles further to the
west where they intended to stop
and look about for a permanent
home. The woman and children
were stiff and sore from the jolts of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the springless wagon as it bumped
over huge rocks, or suddenly slid
into wide ruts made by washouts.
But they never complained about
aching bones, for they knew the
father couldn't help them, and they
were trying to keep up his spirits.</p>

<p>"Dean and I continued along the
trail until we came to the flooded
region that made him miss my coming
the day before. The river
seemed higher than ever, Dean said,
and we had to try the roundabout
way again. We traveled along the
banks for at least thirty miles, but
not a spot could be found where we
could ford, or even swim our horses.</p>

<p>"Finally, we pulled rein to discuss
the problem, when Dean saw a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
thin wreath of smoke rising among
the trees near at hand. As no forester
ever permits the sight of smoke
to go uninvestigated for fear of forest
fires, he jumped off of his horse
and rushed into the woods. After
a short time he returned with our
friend the hunter and an Indian.</p>

<p>"'The men say we can't get over
to-day&mdash;we'll have to wait about until
the water recedes somewhat,'
Dean explained.</p>

<p>"'Can't we cross where you did
last night?' I asked.</p>

<p>"'Not to-day&mdash;the water has risen
much higher since then and it
would be taking too much of a
chance to risk it. We'll stay here
until it is safe,' said Dean, as he led<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
his horse into the woods toward the
Indian's temporary camp.</p>

<p>"I followed the three men and
wondered how the Indian ever got
the name of Mike. Later I heard
that his own name was so hard to
pronounce that everyone who knew
him abbreviated it to 'Mike'.</p>

<p>"Well, we camped and hunted
and fished there with the two elderly
men for a week before we could
go on, but it was a week of rare
sport, for the hunter and trapper
were experts, and they had many
exciting stories to tell of narrow escapes
from wild animals and other
adventures.</p>

<p>"Dean and I finally arrived at the
lumber camp where the men had decided<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
to send out a scout to trail
Dean, who they feared was lost, or
injured somewhere on the way. So,
they were greatly relieved to see us
ride along the river-road that led
into the camp which consisted of a
small group of huts."</p>

<p>"Daddum, that story wasn't as
good as most of yours are," criticised
Don.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not, my son," laughed
Mr. Starr, "for I see we are nearing
our destination and I only planned
to keep up the tale long enough to
keep you from thinking of your tired
selves."</p>

<p>"Get there in about seven minutes,
sir," announced the old conductor
as he shuffled through the car.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hurrah!" cried Don, jumping
upon the seat to get his baggage.</p>

<p>"Why, I can't see any town!" exclaimed
Dot, looking out of the car
window.</p>

<p>"Don't bother about the town,
Dot, but take your hat and jacket
out of the rack," advised Lavinia,
who was busy trying to gather together
the various belongings of the
family.</p>

<p>"Babs! Wake up, little sister,"
called Mrs. Starr as she gently shook
the sleepy little girl.</p>

<p>"Is 't mornin'?" yawned the
baby.</p>

<p>Everybody laughed so that Babs
soon sat up and looked about in surprise.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, see out there&mdash;the funny
place!" exclaimed Dot.</p>

<p>"That's the city where we shall
stay over night," said Mr. Starr, carrying
suit-cases and grips toward
the door.</p>

<p>A surprise awaited the Starr family
as they descended from the train,
for Mr. and Mrs. Latimer were there
to greet them.</p>

<p>"Well, when did you get here?"
asked Mr. Starr, after greetings were
over.</p>

<p>"Day before yesterday, so we
thought we would wait and start for
the camp together," returned Mr.
Latimer.</p>

<p>As there were no porters or cabs
in the isolated town, they had to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
carry their own luggage. Mr. Latimer
undertook to find a boy with a
wheelbarrow to take the trunks to
the hotel. "Hotel! Is there such a
thing here, Mr. Latimer?" laughed
Meredith.</p>

<p>"Wait until you see! You will
be very proud to send home picture
post-cards of the place!" replied
Mrs. Latimer.</p>

<p>"Where's Paul and Marjory?"
suddenly asked Meredith, who had
missed Jinks, his chum, on the trip
from Oakdale.</p>

<p>"Why, Marjory is reading to an
old invalid this afternoon and Paul
went fishing with some boys," explained
Mrs. Latimer.</p>

<p>While the Starrs are following<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
their friends, the Latimers, from
the station to the hotel, let us see
how they all came to be in this faraway
place in Canada.</p>

<p>When the Starrs left the island in
Casco Bay in the early part of September,
Mr. Latimer, who lived in
Portland, Maine, mentioned a trip
to the lumber regions of Canada.
As Mr. Starr was interested in a
large lumber deal with Mr. Latimer,
and had spent his summer in Maine
on that account, he decided to associate
himself with Mr. Latimer in
the Canadian Pine Investment Co.</p>

<p>Consequently, the Starr family
packed up their belongings and returned
to Oakwood from Maine several
weeks sooner than they had expected,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
for it was necessary that the
children be completely fitted out
with warm clothing, and other necessities,
if they were to spend the
winter in a lumber camp with the
Latimers.</p>

<p>Of course, Mrs. Starr worried
about keeping the children from
school all winter, but Mrs. Latimer
said that the governess, who had
been with her children for several
years, could so arrange her hours
that all the children could study under
her direction. This arrangement
satisfied Mrs. Starr, and the only
drawback to enjoying the novelty
of life in a lumber camp was entirely
removed.</p>

<p>The Starrs left Oakwood the latter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
part of October and reached
Grand Forks the first of November.
From there they traveled by various
routes until they reached their destination
in the extreme southeastern
part of Manitoba.</p>

<p>Here, the Latimers awaited them,
and had made all arrangements for
the further journey into the heart of
the forests where the pine and other
valuable timber stood.</p>

<p>The lumber crew, consisting of a
foreman, cook and two helpers, hostlers,
drivers, and most of those that
felled trees, had gone on to the camp
some time previous to the Starrs'
arrival, but a few of the men were
still in town waiting for their foreman.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>The lumbermen who were waiting
to start for camp stood about the
small stoop of the house which was
known as the "hotel," and scanned
the group slowly walking toward
them. The Latimers were already
known to the men, but the new-comers
were a source of curiosity.</p>

<p>The men who were to supervise
the cutting, hoisting and hauling of
the timber to be cut that winter were
of a rugged, good-natured type, and
the Starrs were glad to note their
clean-cut appearance.</p>

<p>Mr. Latimer had explained to the
new arrivals the presence of the crew
at the hotel, and also the various
work the different men had charge
of. Don and Dot had overheard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
this conversation, and the moment
the family reached the porch Don
carefully looked over the group and
whispered to Dot. Together they
walked over to the men and entered
into an animated discourse with
them.</p>

<p>"I heard that one of you men was
an engineer on the engine that pulls
the trees out of the woods," said
Don.</p>

<p>"I'm the one," remarked a tall
muscular man, while his companions
smiled at the two children.</p>

<p>"We know how to run an engine,"
began Dot.</p>

<p>"Sh!" interrupted Don to his sister.
"We didn't come over to tell
you that, but we wanted to say that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
we are glad to meet you. We three
ought to have some nice rides this
winter on that engine of yours."</p>

<p>This brought a laugh from all but
the engineer. He looked very serious
as he said, "I sure am glad to
make your acquaintance. I reckon
we'll be very friendly." And he
stuck out his large hand and shook
Don's and Dot's small hands most
energetically.</p>

<p>"Did you say you run an engine?"</p>

<p>"Yep! when we were down on my
grandfather's ranch in Texas. There
were some Indians always stealing
and hiding in the woods and Dot
and I helped catch 'em," said Don,
looking about to see if any of his
family overheard his remark.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don, that wasn't when we drove
the engine. You know&mdash;I mean the
time the old thing ran away with us
and everybody was so frightened!"
corrected truthful Dot.</p>

<p>"Well, it doesn't matter, now,"
hurriedly said Don. "I haven't
heard your name yet, mister. My
twin-sister's is Dot an' mine is
Don."</p>

<p>"My name is Jim&mdash;Jim Akerman,
all told, but just call me Jim. An'
now I'll introduce you to the crew
if you like," said the man, smiling
at the twins. "This man is fireman
on the engine and his name is Pete.
We call him Pete on account of his
job of piling peat on the fire."</p>

<p>"Do you use peat? Why, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
thought you burned wood," said
Don.</p>

<p>"We do up here, but down in
Carolina we used a lot of bog-peat,
'cause it's so hot a fire," explained
Jim; then continued:</p>

<p>"Here's Bill, the tackle man; an'
Jake, the swing-man; Ben and Johnny,
there, are hook-men. Then
there's Alf, Jerry, and Mack, who
have charge of the cables."</p>

<p>Just as the introductions were
over, Mr. Starr called from the front
door telling the children to come in
and dress for supper.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>A LUMBER CAMP IN WINTER</h3>


<div class='cap'>THE boss of the machinery crew
came by the morning train
and the next day the entire party
were ready to start on their way.</div>

<p>The men rode, while the women
and children sat in a comfortable
carry-all drawn by four horses. The
baggage and extra camp outfits were
packed in a cart drawn by two mules.</p>

<p>"Jus' like a picture of folks going
west in the gold-fever time," ventured
Don, looking ahead at the escort
and behind at the cart and a few
riders.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let's play we are pioneers, shall
we?" cried Dot, always ready for
an exciting adventure.</p>

<p>"And Mete can be the pioneer and
Venie his wife. Babs will be their
only child," explained Don.</p>

<p>"Then who are we?" asked Dot.</p>

<p>"Me and you? Why, we are the
Indians that hold up the wagon and
shoot everyone," replied Don, trying
to look savage.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, if we had only known
this we could have worn our Indian
suits that we left home," sighed
Dot.</p>

<p>"Never mind; I'll pin on this
horse-blanket that's under the seat,
and you can wrap this linen dust-coat
about you," said Don, dragging<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the blanket out from its hiding
place.</p>

<p>"I won't look a bit like an Indian
in that old coat. Can't you see another
blanket with stripes on it?"
asked Dot.</p>

<p>"Not a blanket, but here's a plaid
lap-cover," replied Don, as he spied
the cotton cover under the blanket.</p>

<p>"What are you children pulling
from under that seat?" asked Mrs.
Starr, who always watched the twins
in fear and trembling.</p>

<p>"We're jus' goin' to be Indians
and wear these things," explained
Don, carelessly.</p>

<p>Meredith had been sitting with
the driver of the cart for some time,
hearing stories of life in the wilds,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
and Lavinia had been playing with
Babs during the time the travelling
was bad, when the wagons went
slowly.</p>

<p>This was Don's opportunity.</p>

<p>Dot and he managed to get out of
the back of the carry-all unnoticed.</p>

<p>They hid behind some bushes and
as the leaders came opposite, Don
jumped out and shouted, dancing
about and waving a club over his
head. Dot followed her brother's
example, and both pranced and
shrieked such blood-curdling yells
that Mrs. Starr almost fainted while
Mrs. Latimer hurriedly leaned out
of the wagon to see who had been
run over.</p>

<p>The horses merely jumped at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
unexpected apparitions, then kept
plodding up the hill. Don and Dot
clambered up the steps of the carry-all
trying to mimic the real scalpers,
but Mrs. Starr caught each one
by an arm and bade them sit down
and not get out again without her
permission.</p>

<p>Meredith had witnessed the whole
performance from the cart and
laughed teasingly at the climax of
the raid.</p>

<p>The journey took two days; the
first day, at five o'clock, Mr. Latimer
called a halt for camp. This
part of the trip was great sport for
the children for they roamed about
the woods while the men cut fir
branches for beds, and watched the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
cook prepare a fine dinner out in the
wilderness.</p>

<p>The second day, about noon, the
travellers reached the place selected
for a permanent camp. Of course,
everyone was deeply interested in
the novel appearance of their winter
home and, as soon as the twelve
o'clock dinner was served, started
in to investigate the quarters.</p>

<p>The children trailed after the
grownups, making their own observations
of affairs.</p>

<p>The bosses' cabins were among
some magnificent trees, about one
hundred yards from the main camp.
They were rough little log huts large
enough to hold four bunks, two on
either side&mdash;a lower and an upper<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
bunk&mdash;and a chest of drawers at
the side opposite the door. An
opening in the roof gave ventilation,
and a small square window at
each side of the chest of drawers
gave light in the daytime. The only
light to be had at night was from a
candle, and heat, if the city folks
needed any, must be had from oil
heaters, several of which had been
included in the outfit.</p>

<p>The bunks of the crew were directly
opposite the "bosses'" huts.
A large cleared space lay between
the two sections, and at one end
stood the cook's quarters, with a long
shed-like cabin in front of it to
screen the kitchen from the company.
This shed was dining-room,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
parlor, and general social center. At
the fourth side, opposite the dining-room
and kitchen, was a commodious
office with three rooms. Here the
clerical force worked, and the bosses
planned and ordered the work of the
company.</p>

<p>This sort of life suited Don and
Dot perfectly, and they peeped into
every bunk, and hovered about the
kitchen, with the satisfaction of
having reached the great goal in life.</p>

<p>"This bunk is for the children&mdash;Don
and Dot, Venie and Babs," explained
Mr. Starr, showing the
bunks adjoining the hut which
would be occupied by himself and
wife.</p>

<p>"Can't Dot and I have a hut all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
to ourselves?" asked Don, who
hoped to have great fun in these little
huts.</p>

<p>"Not much!" laughed Mr. Starr.
"I doubt if Venie can keep you two
in order, but we will try it."</p>

<p>"Where's Mete going to live?"
asked Dot eagerly.</p>

<p>"Meredith and Paul will have
bunks in the same hut with the foreman,
and Elizabeth has a bunk partitioned
off from her father and
mother's half of a hut," replied Mrs.
Starr.</p>

<p>"Well, guess I'll have a look at
my house," ventured Don, stepping
into the log cabin which was to be
his abode for a time.</p>

<p>"Dot, look'a here! they don't have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
bed-springs in these bunks," whispered
Don, lifting up a corner of a
sweet smelling mattress.</p>

<p>"And the mattress! What is it
stuffed with?" exclaimed Dot.</p>

<p>"Don't know, but it smells fine,
don't it?" said Don.</p>

<p>Meredith and Paul peeped in just
then and seeing the two examining
the beds, laughed.</p>

<p>"You ought to see ours, if you
think the company ought to provide
you with Dutch feather-beds," said
Paul.</p>

<p>"What are yours?" Don asked.</p>

<p>"Just balsam branches heaped up
in the bunks; we spread a blanket
over them at night and sink into
peaceful dreams."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then we want balsam branches,
too," demanded Dot.</p>

<p>"Why should we have these
things if the other men have branches?"
queried Don.</p>

<p>"We'll ask Daddum next time we
see him," said Meredith, as Paul
and he continued on their way.</p>

<p>"Dot, we'll just go over and take
a look at those balsam beds. If we
like them better, we will ask Mumzie
to have ours changed. If ours is
best, we won't say anything," whispered
astute Don.</p>

<p>They found Paul's bunk filled
with balsam branches as he said, but
they felt perfectly content with their
nice soft mattresses after the balsam
had been tested.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>Before any further matters of interest
could be found, a deafening
sound came from the cook's quarters.
The twins ran out to the clearing to
find the meaning of the noise, and
saw one of the cook's helpers walking
about banging a wooden potato-masher
furiously upon the bottom of
a brass pan. The echoes of the
strokes could be heard coming from
every direction in the forest.</p>

<p>"What's that for?" asked Don,
running over to Mose, the helper.</p>

<p>"I'se callin' you-alls for dinner,"
grinned Mose.</p>

<p>"Hey, Dot! come quick," called
Don, turning to see if his sister was
in sight. "It's dinner time, and
Mose is ringin' the bell."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>Without further ado, Don went
over to the shed and looked for his
place at the long table. For once he
was undecided. There were two
long tables, and the places set were
so exactly alike that Don was not
sure where he was supposed to sit.</p>

<p>"Where are all of the other men,
Daddum?" asked Lavinia, seeing
that only half of the men were
present.</p>

<p>"They have been cutting out
rough roads from our timber to the
river, and have taken their dinner
in pails, as it is too far for them to
come to camp and then return afterward,"
said Mr. Starr.</p>

<p>"What river, Daddum?" asked
Don, quickly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>"The river down which the logs
float in the spring," said Mr. Starr.</p>

<p>"Do you own the river?" asked
Dot, wondering how much of the
earth her father possessed.</p>

<p>"We own the right to use it for
our logging business," replied Mr.
Starr, and smiled at his little girl's
disappointed look.</p>

<p>"Why do they cut roads, Daddum?
Aren't there any ready made
that you can use?" asked Dot.</p>

<p>"Not in the forests, Dot. We
have to break out roadways so the
heavy skidding and loading machines
can go in among the trees and
lift the cut timber up and on the
sledges that will cart it down to the
water," explained Mr. Starr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>"You will soon be able to see the
way it has to be done and then you
will understand better," added Mr.
Latimer.</p>

<p>"When can we see&mdash;this afternoon?"
asked Don, impatiently.</p>

<p>"Maybe you will have time to go
with me directly after dinner,"
hinted Mr. Latimer.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes! Of course we will,
'cause we don't begin lessons 'till
Monday, you know," exclaimed
Don and Dot together.</p>

<p>The rice pudding was almost forgotten
that day, so eager were the
children to go and see the interesting
work of the men of the camp.</p>

<p>They trudged along the newly
cut road which they had travelled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
over in the morning, but, after walking
for half a mile, Mr. Latimer left
the road and went along a narrow
trail that ran into the thick forest.
Walking along this for a mile or so,
the children heard the sound of
chopping, and crashes every now
and then, and the shouting of men
to each other. In about ten minutes'
time they could see moving figures
between the thick trunks of
trees, and soon came to the place
where the road was being broken
out.</p>

<p>Here, indeed, was activity and
exciting work. The children were
cautioned about the danger.</p>

<p>Don watched with every faculty
strained to its utmost. He saw an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
opening through the thick growth of
pine trees running far into the
depths of the forest. In the opposite
direction, where the men were
working, the forest remained intact.</p>

<p>"Guess that's the road Daddum
said they were breaking out," he
commented, to the other children.</p>

<p>"An' that's what they have to cut
down to get out to the river," added
Paul, pointing toward the thick
trees on the other side.</p>

<p>Suddenly, a shout of "Ye-ho!"
was heard and the lumbermen ran
off in every direction, while a crackling
sound came from the tree that
was being cut; in another moment
down crashed the giant pine, tearing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
away obstructing branches from
other trees.</p>

<p>"Oh!" sighed Don, clutching his
hands in tense interest, and the
other children sat as rigid as statues
until the tree was down.</p>

<p>Some men instantly hopped upon
the fallen giant and started lopping
off the branches, while the other
men began work on the next tree in
the road.</p>

<p>The "breaking out" of the road
through the virgin forest kept on in
this way until the men were some
distance farther on than they were
when the children first came upon
the scene. When Mr. Latimer returned
to take them back to camp
they were quite willing to go.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>That evening the children had a
great deal to tell their mothers and
Don added, "Guess I'll be a lumberman
when I'm big."</p>

<p>"Have you decided to give up
the canal-boat life that you promised
Molly you would lead?" asked
his father, teasingly.</p>

<p>"Well, a man can run a canal-boat
and be a lumberman, too, can't
he?" returned Don, not willing to
admit his loss of interest in the canal-boat
life.</p>

<p>"I always said that it was better
for a man to do one thing and do
that well, than to try and do several
things poorly," hinted Mr. Starr.</p>

<p>The others laughed, for one of
Don's weaknesses was to take a tremendous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
interest in anything new
and then leave it half finished for
the next absorbing idea.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm eating these pork and
beans just now, and I'm doing it
well, ain't I?" retorted Don, making
everyone laugh again.</p>

<p>"Dot and you always do the meal-work
thoroughly," replied Mrs.
Starr, still laughing.</p>

<p>No one about the table that evening
seemed to have a failing appetite,
for the wonderful pine-scented
air and the unusual life made everyone
hungry for the brown bread,
beans, baked potatoes, and slices of
crisp ham.</p>

<p>A huge log fire was built in the
center of the clearing and, immediately<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
after supper, the crew and
the bosses' families sat about it in a
circle while the "timber-children,"
as Mr. Latimer called them, told the
other children wild stories of adventures
in the forests.</p>

<p>Don sat with wide-opened eyes
and body leaning forward listening
eagerly to every word. These tales
were stored away in his mind for
some future development or use.</p>

<p>At eight o'clock Mr. Latimer
called out, "Youngsters' bedtime!"</p>

<p>"Why we never have to go so
early as this," said Don.</p>

<p>"In a lumber camp every man
goes to bed at nine o'clock, sometimes
earlier, if the day is long. We
are up at five, you see, and work<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
from six. Just wait until you see
us work some nights until long after
your tired eyes have closed," explained
Mr. Latimer.</p>

<p>"Crickets! From five until night!
I guess I wouldn't like <i>that</i> life!"
announced Don, emphatically.</p>

<p>"No, indeed," added Meredith,
while <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'eveyone'">everyone</ins> laughed at Don's
honest confession. "Don loves his
warm bed in winter."</p>

<p>As the children rose to leave the
fire, they thanked the men for the
entertainment and said good-night.
The engine-driver had been quite
near to Don all evening and now
Don asked a question.</p>

<p>"'Most ready with that engine that
I'm goin' to help you with?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not yet, Mister Don; we have
to break out that road before I can
run my engine in there, you see,"
whispered the man.</p>

<p>Perfectly contented to think that
he wouldn't miss any fun on that
engine, Don said good-night to Jim
and ran after the family who were
on the way to the bunks.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>THE INDIAN TRAPPER</h3>


<div class='cap'>THE routine of life in a lumber
camp never became tiresome,
but it systematized matters
for the children. Every morning at
five o'clock the rising gong was
beaten by the cook's helper, and at
five-thirty the men had breakfast.
The families ate at six-thirty, and
at seven-thirty an hour was given
to study of the daily lessons. Then
an hour of freedom came, followed
by three hours of close application
to school. The classes met in one
of the large rooms of the office<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
building and Miss Miller had scholars
who were eager to study, for not
one of them wished to be detained
after school; there were too many
wonderful things to be done, and being
detained after school hours
meant the missing of some of the
wonders.</div>

<p>After the first week in camp the
children became quite resigned to
the early rising and breakfast, for
it seemed to lengthen out the hours
of the day so that a great deal more
could be crowded into the time for
fun and play.</p>

<p>On the second Sunday in camp
everyone was sitting in the dining-room
listening while Mr. Latimer
read the service.   He had finished<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
the Bible reading and suggested a
hymn that all of the men knew by
heart, when the door opened at one
end of the shed and a queer old face
peered in.</p>

<p>Don sat nearest the door and, seeing
a stranger at the door, nudged
his twin. She leaned over and
stared at the wrinkled skin, twinkling
eyes, and long straight hair.</p>

<p>"Why, Don, it's an Injun!" whispered
Dot, with surprise.</p>

<p>By this time the door had opened
far enough to admit the stranger
and he stepped in and squatted
down just inside.</p>

<p>Most of the men sitting with faces
toward the door saw him but the
reader and part of his audience were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
not aware of the visitor. Dot nudged
her father and whispered about
the Indian's presence. The service
continued, however, without interruption,
to the final song. Then
many of the men rose and came over
to the visitor.</p>

<p>"Hello, Wilotemike! Where'd
you come from?"</p>

<p>"Wilotemike! Let me see him!"
exclaimed Mr. Starr, in great surprise.
He stepped out before the
old Indian and saw the same friendly
trapper that had advised his
friend Dean about the flooded river,
and entertained them for a week.
He came forward and held out a
welcoming hand.</p>

<p>"Well, well, I don't believe you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
know me, Mike, do you?" asked Mr.
Starr, grasping the old man's hand.</p>

<p>After thinking deeply for a few
moments, the Indian's face lit up
and he smiled recognition at Mr.
Starr.</p>

<p>"Mike know friend! Many moons
he not come back!" said the Indian
reprovingly.</p>

<p>"Not my fault, Mike. Me want
to come but find a nice squaw and
she keep me home," laughed Mr.
Starr, beckoning for his wife to join
him.</p>

<p>Of course the children were shown
to Mike and the old Indian smiled
as he allowed his hand to light gently
upon Bab's yellow curls.</p>

<p>Most of the timber men knew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Mike, or had heard of the trapper,
and he was generally welcomed at
any camp he visited. In this case,
however, he was doubly welcome,
for he was a friend of one of the
bosses, and the story soon went the
rounds of the entire camp.</p>

<p>"Going to visit us for the winter,
Mike?" asked Mr. Latimer, thinking
of the great boon he would be to
go about with the children after
school hours. Knowing the forests
as he did, he could teach and show
them everything and at the same
time prevent any danger from coming
to them.</p>

<p>"Mike set traps nex' moon, way
up mountain," replied Mike, laconically.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mike stay here till time for trap
to catch big game!" eagerly came
from Mr. Starr, who sensed part of
Mr. Latimer's plan.</p>

<p>"Mike, get much money for time
he stay. Mike show little ones all
over woods and teach many good
things about everything!" added
Mr. Latimer.</p>

<p>By this time the ladies realized
what the two men were after, and
abetted the plan with all of their
persuasions.</p>

<p>Mike stood uncertain. He smiled
down at the children who showed
in their faces how delightful life
would be with a real Indian trapper
to show them about the woods, while
the ladies urged the proposition resistlessly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
and the men stood waiting
expectantly for an answer.</p>

<p>"Mike not make much pelts las'
year. Not eat much this year. Mike
tink dis snow make a big pelt time&mdash;make
much money," explained the
trapper.</p>

<p>"Mike take all this money from
this day to trapper's day. Mike go
to mountain on trapper day and set
traps. Watch much. Get big pelt
and come back soon; Mike make
more money here with white man,"
spoke Mr. Starr, taking a roll of
bills from his pocket and counting
out fifty dollars upon the table, giving
Mike to understand that the
money was his if he would remain in
camp until December 15, which day<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
was generally Trapper's Day in the
North.</p>

<p>The Indian looked about at the
faces and saw only the kindly desire
to have him remain, and his eyes became
misty at the unusual welcome
from the white men.</p>

<p>Don and Dot could hardly restrain
their impatience to have Mike
say "yes," so Don ran over, took the
dark hand of the trapper in both his
and shook it, saying, "Come on,
Mike, we want you."</p>

<p>The children all flocked about,
coaxing the Indian to remain, until
he smiled and consented to be their
guard after school hours. Miss Miller
heaved an audible sigh of relief,
for she had had her troubles in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
last two weeks, trying to keep Babs
and the twins always in a "safety
circle" beneath her watchful eye.</p>

<p>Cook came in just then and asked
a question.</p>

<p>"Hey, boss, when is church out?
My dinner is cooked an' waitin' fer
the two boys to set up de tables."</p>

<p>At that everyone hurried out that
the cook might not be delayed in his
programme of feeding so many hungry
people.</p>

<p>"Take Mike into the office and
tell him all you have seen since you
have been here," suggested Mr. Latimer
to the children.</p>

<p>While the children danced over
the frozen ground showing the Indian
the way to the office, the elders<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
gathered in the Starr's log hut and
discussed the value of the trapper.</p>

<p>"Everybody knows Mike for hundreds
of miles around this part of
the country, and he knows every
foot of ground, the depth of waters,
the bog-lands, and the haunts of
wild animals. He is as true and honorable
as any white man, and more
trustworthy than many," explained
Mr. Starr.</p>

<p>"He is almost too old a man to
continue trapping, I should think,"
remarked Mr. Latimer. "Why, he
must be almost seventy years old."</p>

<p>"More than that, I think," replied
Mr. Starr.</p>

<p>"You never can tell an Indian's
age after a certain period. He may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
be a hundred and fifty and he would
not show it any more than to-day,"
said Mrs. Latimer.</p>

<p>"Well, the one essential thing is
that he is perfectly capable and
agile enough to guard the children
in their wanderings," added Mrs.
Starr, who was greatly relieved to
have such a treasure.</p>

<p>"If he would consent to give up
trapping this winter, I would willingly
pay him more than he will get
out of any pelts he might get. And
life here would be much easier for
him without being too civilized,"
said Mr. Starr.</p>

<p>"Well, we'll let him try it for a
time and perhaps he will like the
children enough to wish to remain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
for the season," suggested Mr. Latimer.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the children were
having a glorious time with their
new friend and guardian. The
twins were enchanted to be living
with a real, true Indian, and Babs
seemed to take a violent fancy to the
long haired old man.</p>

<p>Mike was like one of the children,
telling them Indian legends in his
own queer English, which Paul called
"Pidgin English." The afternoon
passed quickly for the children
and they were all amazed when the
gong banged for supper.</p>

<p>The following day while the children
were at school, Mike looked
about the camp with curiosity and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
then walked away to see how much
timber the men had cut. Unknown
to anyone, Babs quietly crept after
her new play-fellow, and soon was
out of sight of the camp.</p>

<p>Babs was past three years and quite
able to amuse herself at times, and
since coming to the woods she had
enjoyed playing in the clearing with
a toy shovel and pick and a blunt
axe. She liked to make believe she
was chopping down trees and piling
them up in tiny heaps of firewood
that cook's helper generally used for
kindlings. No one was concerned
about the child as she had played
quietly in that way for several days
and she was not given to adventure
like the twins. So, it was with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
startled expression that Mrs. Starr
called Babs and, receiving no reply,
went to the door of the log cabin to
find her. As no Babs was to be seen,
and nobody had seen her anywhere
for the past half hour, Mrs. Starr
felt frightened.</p>

<p>Mrs. Starr and Mrs. Latimer ran
over to the school room to inquire,
but no one had seen Babs there.
Then, they ran to the office where
the two bosses were writing and figuring,
but neither one of them had
seen Babs.</p>

<p>"Where's Mike?" asked Mr.
Starr.</p>

<p>"Oh, I never thought of him," replied
Mrs. Starr with a feeling of
relief.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>"If Mike isn't about the clearing
you can rest assured that he has
Babs with him, and she is as safe as
she would be in bed," said Mr. Starr,
going out of the office to inquire
about Mike at the cook's quarters.</p>

<p>As Mike had not been seen about
for an hour, there was no doubt that
Babs and he were out together.</p>

<p>Now Mike had loped silently
over the frozen ground toward the
direction of the timber cutting,
without ever looking behind him.
Had he glanced back he might have
seen a tiny little girl making great
efforts to follow after him. Mike
was too entirely a creature of nature
to walk in a beaten path when a
short-cut through the woods saved<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
so many steps. Therefore, Babs
found her path beset by many obstacles
as she tried to follow exactly in
the way Mike had chosen.</p>

<p>Her short little legs could not
keep up with his agile old ones, and
soon Babs was left behind. Try as
she would she could not run fast
enough to find Mike again. She
could barely remember in which direction
she last saw him going, and
finally, she sat down upon a flat rock
and cried. She was tired, she was
hungry, she wanted to go home, and
she wanted Mike. But not one of
these wants were satisfied, and she
cried lustily for someone to come
and find her.</p>

<p>Since living in the forest, Mother<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
had often warned the children never
to go out of sight of the clearing, for
there might be bears about the
woods. To add to her fear of being
lost, came a queer sound among the
underbrush.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's a bear!" wailed Babs,
trying to locate the wild beast and
seeking shelter behind a huge tree.</p>

<p>She hugged the immense trunk of
the pine while she poked her yellow
head out to see if the bear was in
sight, but he had not yet come into
view.</p>

<p>She stood behind the tree until
wearied of inaction, and as the noise
could no longer be heard, crept out
of hiding, and Babs started off in a
direction she hoped would bring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
her to Mike. She stumbled and fell
over roots, got up and went on
again; dodged between the thick
growth of pine trees, and finally
came to the road that was broken
out by the men when they first came
to camp&mdash;the road that led to the
trail running into town.</p>

<p>Babs was thankful to find a road
but not sure which direction to take,
and when a little girl is very tired
and hungry and forlorn the work of
thinking hard is apt to put her to
sleep, especially if she sits down
upon a large pile of pine needles
and leans against a stump to think.
And so it was with Babs. She leaned
her tousled curls against the
stump and closed her eyes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>In taking the short-cut to the timber-cutters,
Mike had seen tracks of
wild hares and quail, and finding
that the work in the timber was not
as interesting as he thought it would
be, he decided to follow the road
back and get his rifle to shoot some
game for the cook.</p>

<p>He was quietly loping along the
road when he saw the little white
hood bobbing down behind the pine
stump.</p>

<p>Mike looked all about for some evidence
of the children or elders, but
not a sign or sound was to be heard
except the strange cracklings of forest
silences. Mike gave a shrill
whistle to call anyone who had
strayed close by, but no one answered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
except Babs who was suddenly
awakened from her nap.</p>

<p>"O-oh, Mike! Did oo know I is
losted affer oo?" said she, rubbing
her eyes with her mittened hands.</p>

<p>"Mike take Babby home," coaxed
Mike, lifting the child to his shoulder.</p>

<p>Reaching the clearing Mike carried
Babs over to the office where he
heard how everyone missed the child
and, finding that Mike was gone
also, they felt that Babs was safe,
for doubtless the two were together.</p>

<p>Mike understood perfectly but
said nothing about finding Babs
alone a mile from the clearing, for
he silently vowed never to leave the
little one alone again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>So the devotion of the old man
proved a great boon to Babs, for she
soon knew many simple wood-secrets
that Mike taught her, as well
as being shown the homes of hares,
quail, squirrels, and other small denizens
of the forests.</p>

<p>One day, Mike went off alone,
with his rifle over his shoulder.
Babs had to remain indoors that day
as she had fallen into a pool of water
and had to have all of her clothes
dried in the kitchen. That night
Mike came into camp with a medium
sized deer slung over his back.
Everyone was interested in the
event and watched Mike hang it up
by the legs, while he went to his tiny
log hut and brought out a sharp<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
knife. The deer was soon skinned
and the meat cut up into steaks and
chops which were sent over to the
cook. The skin was then prepared,
as only an Indian can cure it, and
left for a time to season.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with
it, Mike?" asked Don.</p>

<p>But Mike smiled as he shook his
head, refusing to tell.</p>

<p>The children insisted, however,
and Mike confessed that he intended
making a deer-skin suit for Babs to
wear out-of-doors.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>THE ENGINEER'S ASSISTANTS</h3>


<div class='cap'>ONE day, soon after Babs' adventure
in the woods, Mr.
Starr received a letter from a large
machine company at Grand Forks.
He read it aloud at the dinner table,
thereby making all of the timber
men very happy.</div>

<p>"The skidder is on the road,
boys," said Mr. Starr.</p>

<p>"She is!"</p>

<p>"When will she git here?"</p>

<p>"Mos' time&mdash;we are beginnin' to
need her!"</p>

<p>These and many other exclamations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
greeted his news, and Mr.
Starr looked at the date of the postmark
to figure out the time they
might expect the skidder to arrive at
camp.</p>

<p>"The roads are frozen fine and
hard now, and there hasn't been any
snow except a few flakes now and
then, so she ought to get here by tomorrow,
I should think," replied
Mr. Starr.</p>

<p>"It'll begin to look as if we were
workin' some, when the logs begin to
move out toward the river," declared
the foreman.</p>

<p>"She'll have some logs to haul!"
said Mr. Latimer, pleasing the men
by the suggested praise of their
work.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's a skidder, Daddum?"
asked Dot.</p>

<p>"Why do you call it a she?" added
Don.</p>

<p>While many who heard Don's
question, laughed, Mr. Starr tried
to explain to the twins what a skidder
was and what use it was.</p>

<p>"Then the engineer has to drive
her, eh?" asked Don, eagerly looking
over at Jim.</p>

<p>"Yes, he has to steer her, watch
over her steam works, and keep her
from going into the crooked paths of
evil," laughed Mr. Latimer.</p>

<p>"She sure does get into evil ways,
sometimes," added Jim, laughingly.</p>

<p>"Why, I saw one of 'em once, that
was reely possessed with a contrary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
spirit. She never <i>would</i> go the road
she was shown, but allus went down
a side track as like a horse that shies
as anything I ever saw," exclaimed
Bill.</p>

<p>"Ah, but Bill, yeh know why she
shied that way!" said Jerry. "She
was put together skew-geed an' one
side of her was so out of geer that
she couldn't run straight even on a
macadam road."</p>

<p>"There's everything in puttin' the
parts together right, Mr. Starr. Is
the fact'ry goin' to send a man down
to show us how to gear her up and
run her?" asked Jim.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed. We wouldn't take
any chances with such an expensive
machine unless a machinist came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
along to show us what to do in case
of emergency."</p>

<p>The next day a caravan hove into
sight coming slowly along the new
road leading in from the old trail.
As the first team came to the road
broken out from the timber to the
river, some of the lumbermen spied
it. They shouted and soon every
man that could get away from his
job gathered about the interesting
machinery. There were four trucks
and four horses to each truck. The
machinists who came from Grand
Forks to put the different parts of
the skidder together, jumped down
from the driver's seats and shook
hands with the bosses.</p>

<p>"Where are you goin' to run her?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
asked one of the men of Mr. Latimer.</p>

<p>"We'll begin down near the river,
and clear all of that land first; that
will give us open space to pile our
logs along the waterfront and at the
same time pack the road down harder
and harder every trip the teamsters
make," said Mr. Latimer.</p>

<p>So, the heavy trucks were taken
in upon the new road broken out between
the dense pine trees and, after
several miles on this road, a halt was
called. A small clearing had been
made by cutting down all of the timber.
Here the skidder would find
space in which to swing her great
arms and lift the immense trunks
from their resting place over to the
low sledge waiting to receive them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>It took all of that day and the
greater part of the next to fit the
machine up for work. The horses
of the party were cared for by the
men but extra bunks there were
none, for visitors were not expected,
so the men had to sleep upon the
floors of the offices and school-room.
Being city men, it was rather interesting
to sleep upon a heap of fresh
hemlock boughs and wash in a shed
where a long row of basins and towels
were provided for the men. But
the few days braced them up wonderfully,
and they always delighted
in telling of the camp where the cook
prepared fine meals, and the system
and orderliness of the timber men
were so good that ladies and children<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
mingled with them as freely
as if they were the sons of clergymen.
As timber men had the reputation
of being everything coarse
and evil, this story gave an entirely
new view of them.</p>

<p>As soon as the parts were together,
the experts tried the machine.
She soon had steam up in her boilers
and, at the signal, one of the men
threw out her tackle and a huge pine
trunk was lifted as lightly as a
feather and carried over and laid
parallel with the roadside.</p>

<p>The men stood about in a circle
admiring the wonderful machine
that seemed almost human in its
methods of work; the long arms that
reached out in the direction of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
fallen tree, the fingers that opened
to grip the trunk, the graceful swing
of the arm as it carried the log exactly
where it was wanted and then
opened its hand again to give up
the grasp the fingers had on their
burden.</p>

<p>"If you had your sledge here by
the roadside we could load up a pile
in no time and the men could cart
them to the river," said one of the
experts to Mr. Latimer.</p>

<p>"I figured on that and told several
teamsters with sleds to come
with us," replied Mr. Latimer.</p>

<p>"She makes the work jump along
all right!" ventured the foreman,
greatly pleased with the headway
he could make.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>The machinists remained all that
day to watch the men work with
"Jumpin' Jane" as she had been
called, and, the following morning,
left the camp to return to the city.</p>

<p>The work of cutting, loading and
hauling logs went forward with tremendous
speed after Jumpin' Jane
arrived.</p>

<p>After a week's work the logs began
to bank up along the river's
edge, while the clearing about the
Jumpin' Jane grew into a wide area.</p>

<p>The ladies and children at camp
heard stories every night of the experiences
of the day and felt sorry
that they could not witness some of
the adventures. Finally, Mrs. Latimer
spoke:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>"If it is a fine day tomorrow, why
can't we come down to the cutting
and see Jumpin' Jane work? We
want to see everything worth while."</p>

<p>The next day was cold and clear
and the children were bundled up
well, while the ladies muffled themselves
to the ears. Mike was included
in the party, and, as usual,
had charge of Babs.</p>

<p>The men knew there was to be an
observation party, so had work
planned that would show off the
spectacular part of lumber cutting.</p>

<p>"Ho, there, Jim, can we come up
on Jumpin' Jane and help you?"
called Don, when he saw his old
friend fingering the valves and levers
of the engine.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pretty soon, mebbe. It's all up
to your ma," said Jim.</p>

<p>"Not now, Don; wait until we see
how it works," replied Mrs. Starr,
catching hold of Don's hand to keep
him beside her.</p>

<p>Meantime, the timber men had
been running a huge saw through a
giant pine tree until the foreman
shouted "All Back!"</p>

<p>Instantly, everyone ran to safety,
except the man who fastened the
"clutch" of the Jumpin' Jane into
the trunk of the tree. Then he too
ran back to join his associates.</p>

<p>The foreman gave the signal,
Jumpin' Jane gave a little wrench,
and lo! the king of the forest started
to lower his head.   With a crash and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
a dragging off of all the branches
impeding its descent, the pine measured
its enormous length along the
cleared ground. No sooner was it
down than a dozen men jumped over
and lopped off boughs until it looked
like a telegraph pole. Another
signal was given to Jim, and he
pushed a lever that governed the
huge steel arm of the machine. This
arm swung over toward the pine and
whirled out a cable with the hooks
wide open ready to clasp about the
tree. A man stood by and as soon as
the hooks descended he guided them
about the trunk and locked them. A
signal, and Jim pushed upon another
lever that brought the steel arm
back to first position, dangling the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
immense pine over the flat sledge as
if it were a tooth-pick. A man was
waiting to use his cant-hook to
steady the log at one end while the
cable deposited its freight lengthwise
on the floor of the sledge. Before
the steel arm of Jumpin' Jane
could be signalled for another trip,
another huge tree had been sawed
through and awaited its downfall.</p>

<p>Don and Dot were so excited over
Jumpin' Jane that they could not
keep their eyes from her. After constant
coaxing, they succeeded in
gaining unwilling permission to
climb up to the engineer's caboose
and watch Jim work.</p>

<p>Jim managed to show them the
different levers and valves during<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the intervals between loading and
lifting. The twins were completely
fascinated by the machine and asked
many pertinent questions that Jim
delighted in answering. If Jim had
known the twins better, or had spent
the summer with them on the ranch
in Texas, he would not have explained
so minutely how the engine
worked. But he thought they
craved knowledge, and he told them
all he could.</p>

<p>After witnessing all of the
branches of the work, the visiting
party started back but Don and Dot
looked behind, wistfully, many
times before the trees hid the Jumpin'
Jane from their view.</p>

<p>The men worked late that night<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
as the following day would be Sunday
when they could rest. Jim wondered
what would be best to do&mdash;bank
up the fires in Jumpin' Jane or
let them die out and build fresh ones
on Monday morning. Deciding to
act upon the latter plan, he saw that
everything about the great truck
and engine was in perfect order,
then ran after the men who had
started for the clearing.</p>

<p>"The first thing Monday morning,
we must have Jane hoist some
of those small trees out of our way.
They have been cluttering the work
all afternoon, but I was so anxious
to get those big trees down on the
river crib that the little ones just had
to lay there and wait a turn," said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Mr. Latimer, as they reached camp.</p>

<p>Now, Don and Dot had plotted
all afternoon just what they could
do if they had an opportunity to
run Jumpin' Jane. They overheard
Mr. Latimer's sentence as he passed
the little ice-puddle where the twins
were sliding, and they looked at
each other knowingly.</p>

<p>That night, just before the children
were sent to bed, Don and Dot
crept to the Cookee's bunk and asked
for some bread and butter. The
twins were great favorites with
Cookee, so he grunted as he rose from
his chair and went to the shed where
he kept his stock.</p>

<p>"Oh, Cookee, those are nice apples!"
hinted Don.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>"Want some?" laughed the man,
handing an apple to each child.</p>

<p>"An' I love crackers, too," added
Dot, seeing a can of graham crackers
standing upon the shelf.</p>

<p>"Here, now, take this sandwich,
an' I'll give ye each a cracker," said
the Cookee, handing a thick double
slice of bread and jam to the children.
Then taking out a handful
of crackers, he gave them to the
eager hands that were outstretched.</p>

<p>"Whist, now! run off to bed wid
ye," laughed he, watching the twins
skip across the clearing toward their
own bunk.</p>

<p>As the twins were afraid that Lavinia
might hear them talk inside,
they whispered before they entered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
the bunk. Don placed a sandwich
in each deep pocket of his mackinaw
coat, and pushed an apple on top of
each. The crackers were too tempting
to keep, so they were gradually
nibbled until all disappeared. The
twins then stole softly to bed, to
wait until everyone was asleep.</p>

<p>Dot did her very best to remain
awake, but her eyes refused to obey
orders and soon she was fast asleep.
Not so, Don. He made up his mind
to keep awake and, when his eyelids
started to drop over his eyes in sleep,
he pinched himself. Finding that
this plan soon lost its effect, he sat
bolt upright in bed until he heard
Lavinia breathing regularly in her
sleep.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>Don slept in the upper berth, or
bunk, so he had to scramble down
without making any noise. He
dragged his blankets after him, and
then proceeded to wake Dot up
without causing an outcry. Dot was
tired and slept heavily, but he succeeded
in rousing her after a struggle,
and she began to remember the
great fun they were going to have
with Jumpin' Jane. She crawled
cautiously out of bed and took her
blanket out.</p>

<p>Both children donned their heavy
clothing and pulled toboggan hoods
down over their ears. Then wrapping
the blankets about them, they
opened the door on a crack to see if
the coast was clear.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>Being Saturday night, the men
and elders of the camp were still in
the dining-room. The timber-jacks
were playing cards while the Starrs
and Latimers were having a game of
chess. All was quiet in the solemn
light of the full moon.</p>

<p>"Good! We can get away easy,"
whispered Don, as he stepped carefully
from the doorway.</p>

<p>Dot followed and closed the door
behind her.</p>

<p>The twins ran forward as fast as
they could until they were out of
the circle of light shed by the great
lanterns that were hung on trees all
about the clearing. Then they went
slower as they reached the cut-road.</p>

<p>"Yah! I'm sleepy," yawned Dot.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>"So'm I," said Don.</p>

<p>"It's awful cold," shivered Dot.</p>

<p>"Wait till Jumpin' Jane gets
fired up an' you won't feel cold,"
encouraged Don.</p>

<p>They tried to hurry over the frozen
rough road but found the blankets
an impediment, so Don suggested
that they take them off and
carry them instead. This was done
and walking was much easier.</p>

<p>"I'm hungry, shall we eat the apple?"
asked Dot.</p>

<p>"You'll be hungrier for breakfast
if you eat the apple now. Remember,
we ate the crackers," said Don.</p>

<p>So Dot stoically resisted the
temptation to devour the apple in
Don's pocket.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so tired! Let's sit down
here a minute and rest," said Dot.</p>

<p>"No, you <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'musn't'">mustn't</ins>! Haven't you
ever heard that it's dangerous to sit
down in the cold when you're tired?
Folks get frozen stiff that way,"
said Don.</p>

<p>After a long, cold walk&mdash;the latter
half dragged out by half-frozen
feet&mdash;the children reached the spot
where the timber cutting was being
done. The gaunt forest trees looked
very weird in the moonlight, and
Jumpin' Jane stood like a grim ogre
waiting to swallow anything so
small as the twins.</p>

<p>"Oh! but she looks awful!" whispered
Dot, as they drew near the
great black thing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hope her fires didn't go out!
We couldn't have a speck of fun if
they were," worried Don, as he
climbed up inside the caboose to investigate.</p>

<p>Don had flung his blanket over
Dot's arm while he climbed into the
machine, but soon he reappeared
and told Dot to come in out of the
cold, taking the blankets from her
while she got up.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>JUMPIN' JANE'S ANTICS</h3>


<div class='cap'>"HERE, Dot, throw the blankets
down on that seat,"
said Don, pointing to a tiny bench
next to the boiler.</div>

<p>"I don't see's it's any warmer in
here than outdoors," grumbled Dot,
rubbing her eyes and yawning again.</p>

<p>"Soon will be. I haven't looked
at the fire, yet," returned Don, as
he tried to open the fire-pot door.</p>

<p>"Gee! fire's most out! I've got to
get some wood an' keep her going
or we won't have any fun in the
morning."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>"There's some pieces right by
your side," said Dot, seeing a few
sticks of pine lying by the fire-pot.</p>

<p>"Good stunt! This'll keep her
going till I can get some more."</p>

<p>"I saw a big heap of pine knots
and thick chunks of wood piled in a
heap back there," Dot yawned.</p>

<p>"Ah, stop your yawning an' help
me, can't you!" cried Don, with exasperation
as the wood refused to
burn.</p>

<p>"What d'ye want me to do?"
asked Dot, testily.</p>

<p>"Go back and get some of those
chunks," replied Don.</p>

<p>"I will if you go with me, but I'm
not going to walk past those woods
alone. A bear might jump out!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pooh, no bears about&mdash;wish there
were, then we'd have some fun
catching him," bragged Don.</p>

<p>"Yes you would, like you did the
brown calf on the canal," teased
Dot. As the calf-bear story was
one Don preferred forgotten, he
made no answer, but prepared to
accompany his sister.</p>

<p>"When we get back, that wood <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'in in'">in</ins>
there will be burning," said he,
taking a last look at the smouldering
pine.</p>

<p>The twins found the heap of wood
and took as much as their arms
could carry. This was strenuous
work for the chunks were heavy and
awkward, and the children cold and
tired. They managed, however, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
lift them to the engine room and
then Don easily dragged them over
to the door.</p>

<p>Meantime, his fuel had ignited
and the pine was beginning to burn
brightly. One of the large chunks
was thrown in and the children felt
better. As soon as the chunk started
blazing the whole place began to
grow warmer, and the children grew
drowsier.</p>

<p>They laid down in their blankets
to talk plans for working Jumpin'
Jane, but soon fell asleep.</p>

<p>They might have slept on until
found by Jim in the morning, but
the fire died down again and the
cold made the twins restless. Finally,
Don sat up and grumbled for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
more covers. Finding himself on a
hard floor he soon recalled their escapade.
He looked about. The
moon had set and a grey streak
showed through the cut announcing
that dawn was on its way.</p>

<p>"Guess I had better not sleep any
more," said Don to himself, as he
got up and looked into the fire-pot.</p>

<p>"Gee, she's most out again!" said
he, looking about for kindlings.</p>

<p>Some twigs and small pieces of
pine were in a box not seen in the
dark of the night, so Don threw
them all into the embers and as soon
as they were burning, he pushed
one of the chunks of pine inside.
He looked down at Dot and was
about to call her to duty, then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
thought better of it and decided to
have a roaring fire going before he
made her get up.</p>

<p>In the growing light he found all
the pine wood he wanted and soon
had a fierce fire blazing away in the
engine. The sparks that flew out of
the funnel shot up and seemed to
act like tiny demons dancing in the
wind that tossed them up and over
the trees.</p>

<p>Dot awoke with the noise Don
made about the engine, and jumped
up to see what was cracking the engine
to pieces.</p>

<p>"It's the steam!" explained Don.
"I haven't found the right valve to
turn it into the feeder."</p>

<p>"Why, Jim said this big black<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
handle did it," advised Dot, taking
hold of a valve handle.</p>

<p>Don turned it a bit and immediately
the feeder began banging
and cracking like a cannon.</p>

<p>"Sounds just like our radiator in
the playroom at Oakwood, doesn't
it?" grinned Dot.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Don, absent-mindedly,
as he looked out of the little window
at the small trees lying about.</p>

<p>"We may as well carry those trees
out of the way for the men to begin
work tomorrow. You know, Mr.
Latimer said he would have to get
them cleaned out of the path for the
big ones to come down," said Don.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;can you work Jane?"
asked Dot.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sure thing! Didn't Jim show
me just how to do it?"</p>

<p>"What do you want me to do to
help you?" asked Dot.</p>

<p>"We'll have breakfast first, then
we'll go to work," replied Don, taking
the sandwiches from his pocket.</p>

<p>"I'm glad now that I didn't eat
my apple, 'cause I'm so awful hungry.
I just can taste how good
those pancakes and maple-syrup
tastes this morning," said Dot,
smacking her lips.</p>

<p>Don took out an apple and laid
it on the floor, but seemed not to
remember his own.</p>

<p>"That's only one&mdash;where's the
other?" asked Dot.</p>

<p>"Gone!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where? did you lose it?" asked
Dot, sympathetically.</p>

<p>"No, I ate it this mornin' when I
woke up. I did a heap of work long
before you got up and I had to have
something to stay my stomach," admitted
Don, in the words often
heard from Jim.</p>

<p>"Then break mine and take half,"
offered Dot.</p>

<p>Never backward in such things,
Don thanked his sister, and split the
apple in two.</p>

<p>Breakfast over, the two went to
work in their exciting experiments.</p>

<p>"Now, you go over by that tree
trunk and wait for Jane's arm to run
out. The moment I blow the whistle,
you watch out for the tackling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
clutch to come down and lock it
around the tree. Then, I'll work
the arm and bring the tree over by
the roadside and drop it in the
ditch," explained Don.</p>

<p>"You're sure you know which
thing to pull out or push in," ventured
Dot.</p>

<p>"Sure&mdash;watch me!" and Don
opened the valve that sent steam
into the feeder. He pulled a lever
at the left and immediately a great
vibration started as the travelling
crane, or arm, swung about their
heads and tossed the steel cables
about in the air.</p>

<p>"Hi, that's the way, all right!"
laughed Don, at his successful experiment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>Dot saw the cables with the grappling
hooks swing over her head and
dodged down inside the caboose.</p>

<p>"You go over to the trees and play
you're a timber-jack. I'm the engineer
that runs Jumpin' Jane," ordered Don.</p>

<p>Dot jumped down and ran over
to the place where several small
pine trees lay parallel upon the
ground. Don started the lever and
watched the travelling crane swing
around on the opposite side of the
skidder from that where Dot waited
to hook up the grapplers.</p>

<p>"Humph! guess I pushed on the
wrong side of the board," murmured
Don, as he pushed the other lever
over on the right hand side.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>He forgot to pull the first one
back in place so the arm swung over
to the right and back again to the
left, then reversed until its cables
with grappling hooks were swinging
back and forth dangerously near to
the children's head.</p>

<p>Dot screamed: "Turn her off, for
goodness sake! Those hooks'll tear
us to pieces!"</p>

<p>Don was nervous over the error
and wondered why they acted that
way. Suddenly, he saw that he had
not turned off the first lever. As
soon as they were both shut off the
arm remained where it was, and the
cables gradually stopped swinging.</p>

<p>"Say, Don, how long shall I stand
here waiting?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>"Just a minute&mdash;I'm trying another
handle," said Don.</p>

<p>He had spied a smaller handle
near the large one, so he turned on
the large one that sent the crane out
over Dot's head, and then, seeing
that the cables were almost over a
log, he pulled back the small lever.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, until I catch
hold of these lines," shouted Dot,
but Don had already pulled the
small lever over.</p>

<p>As he did so, the grappling hook
caught hold of Dot's belt of patent
leather that fastened her heavy coat
about the waist. The smaller lever
locked the irons and Dot was swung
up high in the air as Don pulled
back the large lever. He was so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
intent upon the machine that he
failed to see his sister up about
twenty feet in the air suspended
over the logs.</p>

<p>Dot was so surprised that she
failed to utter a sound for a moment,
but as soon as she felt herself going
up in the air she started to scream.
One scream after the other rent the
quiet forest morning until Don became
so excited he forgot which lever
to pull that would let the crane
come down to the ground again. He
pulled out the right one and swung
Dot over to the forest trees, then he
pushed it back and swung her back
again.</p>

<p>Meantime, no one missed the
twins for they were supposed to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
asleep in bed. The chess game was
very exciting and, after that, Cookee
served some hot lemonade and cakes,
so that the men and bosses enjoyed
a veritable party. It was later than
usual when they said good-night and
Mrs. Starr went to her cabin to find
Babs dreaming and beating the bed
in her effort to wake up.</p>

<p>In the morning, Jim had a lame
back and stayed in bed longer than
usual. Being Sunday morning, the
breakfast was later than on work
days, and Jim took advantage of
this.</p>

<p>Lavinia awoke and called the
twins but received no answer. She
jumped up and looked in the bunks.
Dot's was empty but pulled to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
pieces, while Don's sheets were
dragged down and the blanket gone.
Instantly, Lavinia recalled kidnapping
stories, and bears and Indians
carrying away little children.</p>

<p>She opened the door and cried for
her mother to come.</p>

<p>"Mumzie, I can't find the twins,
and I can't think where they have
gone!" wept Lavinia.</p>

<p>"Oh, just about somewhere with
Mike," replied Mr. Starr, to console
Lavinia and allay his wife's fear.</p>

<p>"But their blankets are gone and
Don's bed hasn't been used," said
Lavinia.</p>

<p>Mr. Starr stepped up and examined
the upper bunk.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, it has, Viney, but he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
forgot to pull down the second sheet.</p>

<p>"You see the dent in the pillow
where his head lay," said Mr. Starr,
in a tone that made them all feel
easier.</p>

<p>"Just one more of the twins' tricks
of mischief," added Mr. Starr, as he
went out to look for Mike.</p>

<p>But Mike was nowhere about
either, and the family were all quite
sure that the old trapper had taken
the twins out on some new hunt very
early in the morning, and the twins
had thought the sport would be enhanced
if it were kept secret. So,
the camp sat down to breakfast without
a misgiving as to the twins' welfare.</p>

<p>Early that same morning, Mike<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
stole out of his tiny cabin and made
for some distant traps he had set the
day before.</p>

<p>The day was cold and invigorating
and Mike loped over the ground,
straight through the maze of forest
trees as if he were following a pathway.
He reached his traps and
found one sprung but nothing in it,
and the other one just as he had
left it. But tracks all about in the
light covering of snow showed that
several large animals had sniffed at
the bait and tried to get it away.</p>

<p>Mike's eyes smiled with gratification
as he said to himself: "Mike
make big one! Him come agin for
supper!"</p>

<p>Then, seeing there was nothing he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
could do, he decided to walk down
by the river and see how much timber
had been piled in the roll-ways.</p>

<p>From there, he started up the cut
from the river toward the forest-timber
where stood the Jumpin'
Jane.</p>

<p>Several times he stopped and put
his ear to the ground to listen, then
shook his head.</p>

<p>"Mike go old! Mike hear noise!"
said the Indian to himself.</p>

<p>After loping some distance he was
sure he heard the call, and stood perfectly
still to await another sound.
It came.</p>

<p>"Mike good ear!" commented the
old trapper as he started on a swift
run up the road.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>Coming through the dense growth
of trees when quite near the clearing,
Mike saw the cause of the shouting.</p>

<p>There hung Dot, by belt and garment,
high up in the air, while just
under her were several immense
logs. She was too frightened to
kick or squirm, which saved her from
a painful fall.</p>

<p>Don was trying to climb out on
the iron derrick when Mike came on
the scene.</p>

<p>"Dun&mdash;no, no!" cried Mike, running
over to hold Don.</p>

<p>"Mike get lil' gal down," concluded
he.</p>

<p>"You can't budge it, Mike. I've
tried in every way," wept Don, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
was more frightened at seeing his
beloved twin hanging so high above
his head, than Dot was.</p>

<p>Mike had no intention of using
the machinery to lower the derrick,
but he resorted to an Indian manner
of rescue.</p>

<p>He sought for and found a rope
coiled up near some trees. In this
he made a loop which he flung with
such dexterity that it shot over the
upper end of the derrick, just above
the grapple that held the cables. By
pulling on the other end of the rope,
Mike slipped the knot so hard and
fast that nothing could have moved
it from the grapple.</p>

<p>He then ran the other end of the
rope about the trunk of a tree in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
line where Dorothy hung. This
end he fastened, and Mike then
started, hand over hand, up the inclined
rope until he reached the cable
where Dorothy was suspended.
Here he threw an arm over the cable
and twisted his legs about the rope.
In this way he kept his hold of the
rope while sliding himself closer to
the little girl. In a short time he
saw what had clutched her.</p>

<p>"Doot, put arms in Mike's neck!"
advised the Indian.</p>

<p>Dot turned her head as far as she
could and saw Mike's head just beside
her. She tried to squirm about
but could only get her left arm
about the Indian's neck.</p>

<p>"Doot hol' fast?" asked Mike.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sure as anything!" replied the
brave little girl.</p>

<p>"No hands slip?" queried Mike.</p>

<p>"Nope! I can hang on your neck
like a string of beads."</p>

<p>Mike smiled in spite of the danger
and felt assured of the undertaking.</p>

<p>He lifted the child with one hand
as his other, that was slung over the
cable, cut away the belt and coat
that were caught in the irons.</p>

<p>"Now, hol' tight!" warned Mike,
as the last shred was severed and he
swung the little girl about and held
her fast.</p>

<p>"Hip, hip, hurrah!" yelled Don,
as he jumped up and down with excitement.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>An answering call seemed to
come from the direction of the camp,
and Don wondered if they knew of
the escapade.</p>

<p>It was not so easy for Mike to get
hold of the rope again with his hands
as it was to climb up on it, for Dorothy
had to be held with one arm.</p>

<p>After many maneuvers, however,
the old trapper managed to shift the
little girl upon his chest, where both
her arms could hold fast about his
neck. Then he slid down the inclined
rope and soon felt the ground
under his feet.</p>

<p>At the same time, a number of
timber-men, with Mr. Starr, Mr.
Latimer, Paul and Meredith, came
running out of the road that led to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
camp. They were just in time to see
Mike make his descent.</p>

<p>"What's all this?" asked Mr.
Starr, suspicious of the twins' mischief.</p>

<p>"Lil' Doot hang oop there," replied
Mike, not knowing how she got
there, or that he was leading Don
into punishment.</p>

<p>"Don, what <i>does</i> this mean?" insisted
Mr. Starr, sternly.</p>

<p>"Well, you see, Daddum, Dot
and I know all about engines, so
we thought we would help the men
clean away these little trees," Don
started to explain.</p>

<p>"Yes, and try to see just how
much fun and daring you could get
out of it!" remarked his father.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>When the whole story was told,
Don's father reprimanded him severely,
and Don promised never to
be so venturesome again.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>OUTDOOR FUN IN A LUMBER CAMP</h3>


<div class='cap'>SNOW and ice prevailed after the
middle of November, and the
cold was there to stay for the winter.
The roads already cut out had frozen
hard before the snow came, and
that made easy travelling for the
huge sledges that carried the timber
from forest to riverside.</div>

<p>The men were now cutting close
to the main road, and the walk from
camp to cutting was not so tiresome
for the ladies and children, and it
often happened that they visited the
men in the afternoon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>The children had toy hatchets and
saws, and they loved to play about
the felled trees, chopping off small
branches or sawing off rough fragments.
Then, too, it was fine sport
to be lifted up on top of a high heap
of huge logs and ride down to the
river-bank. On the return trip they
would sit down on the low braces of
the sledge, and the horses would
make quick time with no load to
pull.</p>

<p>One Saturday morning the sun
shone so brightly that Mrs. Starr
said the children might go with
Mike, to play near the cutting, but
they must keep a long distance away
from the actual work of the men.</p>

<p>The men had come across a dip in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
the forest which was filled with
water, and this water had frozen
solid during the past week. The
trees had been cut before the ice was
hard, and here was offered a nice
spot for skating. The children slung
their skates over their shoulders and
planned hockey games, and tag, and
other sports on the ice. When they
beheld the pond, however, they soon
realized that it would be impossible
to play hockey, but tag! Yes, tag
would be great fun, as the stumps
stuck up through the ice, here and
there, and the skater could dodge
around these stumps to get away
from the one who was "it."</p>

<p>Babs had her tiny shovel and
hatchet to play with, and Mike sat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
down on a log to watch over the
children. They shouted, skated and
tore at each other for a long time,
then wearied of the game and sat
down on the log by Mike to hear a
story.</p>

<p>Just as Mike finished telling of
an adventure, a loaded sledge came
down the road and Paul called to
the driver.</p>

<p>"Give us a ride?"</p>

<p>"Climb up!" replied the man.</p>

<p>"Room for us all?" asked Meredith.</p>

<p>"'Nodder comin' right behind,"
replied the driver.</p>

<p>Paul looked and nodded.</p>

<p>"Mete, you and the kids get on
this one with Mike, and Vene, Elizabeth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
and I will get on the next load.
We'll all meet down by the river and
come back together."</p>

<p>"Let's take our dinner with us
and eat it down there. Then we can
sit on the logs by the river and come
back with the men on the next
load," suggested Meredith.</p>

<p>"Good idea!" exclaimed Paul.
"You get up on this and I'll run for
the lunch boxes and get back before
the other sleigh gets here."</p>

<p>So the Starr children, with Mike,
climbed up and sat upon the logs of
the first sledge, and the other children
waited for the second load to
come in sight.</p>

<p>The sleigh-ride over the rough
road to the river was great fun, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
often the sleigh would bump over a
huge snow-covered stump or rock,
and make the children roll against
each other and cling fast to the
chains that bound the logs together.</p>

<p>The horses went slowly, for the
loads were heavy and the road hard
and rough, so the ride of two miles
took some time.</p>

<p>The children had visited the roll-ways
at the river before, but had
never had an opportunity to remain
and understand the whole scene.</p>

<p>Arrived at the roll-ways, the men
made quick work of unloading the
logs from the sledge and rolling
them down to the river's edge. In
many cases, where the water was
shallow, or the ice thick enough, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
logs were rolled out a few feet, and
piled up in tiers so that when the
spring freshet came they would sink
down into the water and be the first
to float down stream.</p>

<p>In several instances, rafts had
been made and floated out a short
distance from the shore, and here
the timber-men used to fish before
the river froze over. These rafts
were still there, and the ice between
them and the shore was safe.</p>

<p>After the sledges returned to the
forest, Meredith suggested that they
walk out to the rafts and have their
lunch there. The other children
greeted the idea with glee and Mike
looked carefully about to decide
that it was all right.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mike get fire, boys take dinner
out," advised Mike, as he began
picking up kindlings and pieces of
wood for a fire.</p>

<p>The children picked up their dinner
boxes and started off across the
ice. The largest raft held all of
them, and soon Mike came over with
a huge bundle of wood that he
dragged across the ice to the raft.</p>

<p>He deftly prepared a kindling
fire and placed a few of the large
pine chunks upon it. In a short
time the children were as warm as if
it were summer time, and the smoke
of the wood fire rose straight up in
the clear windless air.</p>

<p>They enjoyed the novelty of the
raft dinner so much that several<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
loads came and the sledges returned
before the children were willing to
talk of going back.</p>

<p>"This is dandy ice&mdash;wish we could
take a skate up and down," ventured
Don.</p>

<p>"'Tis fine ice, isn't it?" abetted
Meredith, looking up and down the
river as far as eye could see.</p>

<p>"Let's! Just one spin around,"
said Paul.</p>

<p>"Mike won't like it," hinted Lavinia.</p>

<p>"Mike won't care. We are perfectly
safe on such thick ice," said
Don, looking out of the tail of his
eye in Mike's direction.</p>

<p>Mike squatted on the raft smoking
his pipe, but he said nothing. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
was thinking over the words the
children had spoken.</p>

<p>"Mike, guess we'll take a spin
over the ice," said Paul.</p>

<p>"Mike no like him&mdash;pouf! full of
holes of air!" said Mike, making a
sound to show the children the danger
of air-holes.</p>

<p>"We know an air-hole when we
see it&mdash;and I can't see any of them
around here," replied Paul.</p>

<p>"Besides, we are only going to
skate around the raft," said Don.</p>

<p>"Mike no like him, big boys like
him, what Mike can do?" said the
Indian helplessly, as he shrugged
his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Mike, I won't go&mdash;neither shall
Dot," said Lavinia.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, but I am, Viney! Don't
think that I am going to sit here like
a baby when Don is off streaking
across the ice or doing the 'outer
edge,'" retorted Dot, taking her
skates from the bag and unbuckling
the heel straps.</p>

<p>Two sledges had finished unloading
and the drivers called out to
Mike.</p>

<p>"Comin' back this trip?"</p>

<p>"Nah! we're going to have a skate
on the ice," shouted Paul, waving
the men back to the forest.</p>

<p>The boys and Dot put on their
skates while Lavinia and Babs sat
beside the fire and watched them.
Mike had gone on shore to find
something.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>After the boys were off, Mike returned
dragging a long slender birch
tree along the ice. He placed it near
the raft and sat down on the edge of
one of the logs, saying nothing about
his errand.</p>

<p>For half an hour, enjoyment of
skating made the forest depths echo
with laughter from the children.
Then they got tired and Paul made
a suggestion.</p>

<p>"Let's go out to that log that
sticks end up out of the ice, and
starting from that, skate back to see
who can win a race."</p>

<p>The idea appealed to the others,
but Meredith ordered Dot to go
back to the raft.</p>

<p>"I, wa-wa-nt to race too! I do-do-n't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
wa-a-nt to g-go back!" chattered
Dot, with blue lips.</p>

<p>"You've got to! You're so cold
now you can't talk straight!" exclaimed
Meredith.</p>

<p>"Ah, go on, Dot! You're spoilin'
my fun!" cried Don, turning to
give Dot a little shove toward the
raft.</p>

<p>"No, I won't," pouted Dot, dropping
upon the ice in sheer contrariness.</p>

<p>"All right, sit there, if you want,"
said Meredith, starting off, followed
by the other two boys.</p>

<p>Dot watched them for a while, but
feeling too uncomfortably cold she
slowly skated back to the raft and
crouched near the fire.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>Mike heard her telling Lavinia
what the boys were going to do, and
he jumped up, grabbed the end of
the birch tree and ran swiftly across
the ice with his sure-footed buck-skins
helping him.</p>

<p>"Hi! Hi!" cried Mike, trying to
get the boys' attention. But the
wind was against him.</p>

<p>"Him channel! Big hole! Water
swish!" yelled Mike, in an
agony of fear lest the boys reach the
channel-mark before he could get
there.</p>

<p>Paul and Meredith were swift
skaters and soon outstripped Don,
but just as they came near the log
which was the goal, Paul's skate
loosened and he fell down on the ice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
Meredith came over to assist him,
and they found that a screw was
loose.</p>

<p>"Don's got a broken knife blade
that we can use for a screw-driver.
We'll wait for him," said Meredith.</p>

<p>Don soon skated up and produced
the knife with the broken blade, and
Paul tried to fasten the screw in
place again.</p>

<p>So intent were they over the repairing
of the skate that neither of
them heard an ominous crack along
the ice as soon as Don's extra weight
came near the log.</p>

<p>A few more dull cracks sounded
as the ice seemed suddenly to become
lined with crooked white lines.
Before Paul could fasten his skate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
on again, however, Mike's voice
reached them.</p>

<p>"Back! Back! Big channel by
log!"</p>

<p>At the same time, a grinding crack
went directly under the boys' feet
and Don shot back toward Mike,
screaming for Meredith and Paul to
come back.</p>

<p>Meredith saw the danger and
tried to help Paul up and away, but
Paul's skate was still loose and it
made him stumble. As he fell down
again, the ice, now all ready to yawn
for its victim, slowly sunk down
with the weight placed upon it, and
Paul was almost submerged before
Meredith could drag him over to the
piece upon which he clung.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>At the same time, Mike ran the
birch tree over the ice and advised
the boys to cling to it for all they
were worth.</p>

<p>Paul had all he could do to cling
fast to the trunk, for the suction of
the channel waters under his stomach
and legs was awful!</p>

<p>After some struggling, however,
Mike and Don dragged on their end
until the boys were pulled over out
of the danger zone of the channel.</p>

<p>During this interval, Lavinia sat
spell-bound with fear, but Babs was
too busy poking twigs in the embers
to notice her sister's white face.</p>

<p>As Mike drew the two boys over
the ice, Lavinia heaved a mighty
sigh and started to cry softly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>"Him big hole! Mike know river
oop and down. Mike lil' Injun, so
big, Mike take canoe oop and
down," explained the trapper, holding
his hand down to his knees to
show the boys how long he had been
acquainted with the treacherous
channel.</p>

<p>Paul was soaked and Meredith
partially wet, so the boys ran over to
the raft where a hot fire was soon
blazing to dry off their outer clothing.
Mike made the older children
sit close together facing the fire,
while he took the dry coats of Don,
Lavinia and Dot, and spread them
over the backs of the five, then he
hung the wet coats upon a sapling
near the heat to dry.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>In half an hour a shout came from
the shore and two more sledges were
emptied of logs and waiting for the
children to go back. In a few moments,
they were all sliding and running
across the ice and clambered
up the bank to get aboard the sleighs.</p>

<p>Dot was eager to tell all about the
accident and rescue, but Mike shook
his head, and Lavinia placed her
hand over her sister's mouth.</p>

<p>The horses were tired after a long
day's hauling and moved slowly
back to the forests where the men
were still cutting timber.</p>

<p>From there, Mike hurried all of
his party along the road toward
camp and told the girls not to speak
of the incident then.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>Meredith and Paul were taken to
Cookee's cabin and made to sit near
the fire while their clothes were
hung up to dry. Lavinia went to
their bunks and brought clean underclothes
to Mike, and so no one
knew of it until several days after.</p>

<p>Don and Dot strolled over to the
office while the others were in the
kitchen, and sat down by the table
to have a game of dominoes.</p>

<p>After playing several games, Don
made a remark.</p>

<p>"Those rafts will make fine play
this spring."</p>

<p>"We won't be here when the river
thaws," replied Dot.</p>

<p>"Maybe&mdash;who knows how long
Daddum'll have to stay."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well&mdash;s'pose we do, what
then?" asked Dot, curiously.</p>

<p>"They're chained fast to the logs&mdash;can't
break away. We can have
heaps of fun playin' on them and
paddlin' them back and forth to the
shore."</p>

<p>"Ye'es, I s'pose so! But I won't
play on 'em until I see for myself
whether the chains are rusty or
good," retorted Dot, thinking of all
the other scrapes her twin had led
her into, in which she generally got
the worst of the bargain.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>CHRISTMAS AT THE LUMBER CAMP</h3>


<div class='cap'>CHRISTMAS was seldom made
much of among the timber-jacks,
but this winter they were to
have such a celebration as they had
never dreamed of before.</div>

<p>Mr. Starr had held several secret
meetings with his wife and the Latimers,
and the result was that one
day in the early part of December,
he took the fastest team and the
sleigh and drove to town.</p>

<p>Mr. Starr went directly to the express
office of the little station and
made inquiries.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>"Has any box come for me from
Grand Forks?" asked he.</p>

<p>"Yaas, guess that's what you're
lookin' fer," replied the man who
was ticket-agent, baggage-master
and express agent, all three in one.</p>

<p>"That's it!" smiled Mr. Starr,
taking his money out to pay the
charges.</p>

<p>"All paid, and nuthin' to c'lect,"
laughed the man.</p>

<p>"Ho, that so? Well, then, just
keep this and buy the kiddies some
Christmas," said Mr. Starr, handing
the man a dollar.</p>

<p>A whole dollar for a present
meant more to this man out in the
wilderness than a hundred dollars
would to one in the city.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>The box was set up in front of
Mr. Starr's feet in the cutter, and the
horses pranced away with sleigh-bells
jingling like a veritable Santa
Claus!</p>

<p>Several stops were made at stores
where candy, pop-corn, trimmings
for trees, fruit, and toys were sold.
Mr. Starr then drove his team to the
stable and left word to be called for
an early start in the morning. He
went into the house, greeted the hotel
keeper who had never before had
a transient guest in the winter, and
had supper with the family. Early
that night he went to bed, leaving
orders to be called at five.</p>

<p>By six o'clock the next morning,
Mr. Starr, with all of his shopping<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
piled in the back, under the seat,
and in front of the sleigh, was flying
back to the lumber camp.</p>

<p>The weather held good, and late
that night the camp heard the jangle
of bells as Mr. Starr drove over to
the stables.</p>

<p>Great secrecy and whispers were
the result of that trip to town. And
many hours, while the children were
at school, Mrs. Starr and Mrs. Latimer
were busy sewing.</p>

<p>Finally, the great festival time
arrived, and everyone wondered
what sort of Christmas fun could be
had out in the woods.</p>

<p>The two ladies had spent several
days in the kitchen showing Cookee
some marvelous things! He had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
never seen a plum pudding cooked
before, but he declared he could
make one like it, after having
watched Mrs. Starr prepare an immense
one.</p>

<p>High, flaky cakes, with chocolate
or jelly between the layers, were
baked and stood hidden in the closet
back of the table.</p>

<p>The timber men had come across
a cranberry swamp in the early days
of cutting and Mrs. Starr had quietly
appropriated the pretty red berries
for a future use. Now they reappeared
as cranberry sauce.</p>

<p>"Huh! who'd a'thought them
sour little balls'd made sich a fine
juice!" exclaimed Cookee, smacking
his lips after a taste of the sauce.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's to go with the venison on
Christmas Day," said Mrs. Latimer.</p>

<p>"Didn't yeh know? Heven't yeh
hearn what Mike cotched?" asked
Cookee eagerly.</p>

<p>"No, what?" asked the ladies, expectantly.</p>

<p>"Couple of wil' turkeys! Dey
was roostin' near his trap, and Mike
ain't never had a catch in it this year,
so he was feelin' like a mighty poor
kind of a trapper, when dese turkeys
lit on a line wid his eye. It was
some job to cotch bote on em, 'cause
one allus flies away soon's a sound
is hearn. But, Mike&mdash;he jest says
to hisself, 'By gum! I'll git bote on
yer or chase yer all over the Nort!'"
and Cookee laughed as he thought of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
Mike's determined manner when he
threw down both turkeys.</p>

<p>"Why, how perfectly lovely! We
will have a real Eastern dinner after
all," cried Mrs. Starr.</p>

<p>"An dat ain't all dere is to it,
nuther! Mike, he's gone duck shootin'
to-day an 'spects to bring back
several brace of ducks to hep out on
de turkeys," said Cookee, grinning
at the way he gave away Mike's secrets
for Christmas dinner.</p>

<p>"We'd better save the venison
steak for New Year's, then," suggested
Mrs. Latimer.</p>

<p>"Huh, huh! I will," replied
Cookee, who was a favored mortal
in camp, for timber-jacks could do
without sleep but not without food.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now's we got the juice done, an'
the cakes baked, I'll jes' show you
what I done made fer the feast," said
Cookee, leading the ladies into a
lean-to shed that he had built up
against the cabin, to store his cooked
foods safely away from men and
children.</p>

<p>In the spare minutes between
meals when he had to cook and serve
food for more than fifty hungry men,
Cookee had delighted in baking
cookies of every conceivable shape.
These were for the children.</p>

<p>From the ankle bones and hoofs
of the deer he had boiled out the
jelly and flavored it with lemon and
nutmeg and made a mould of jelly
that looked exactly like calf's-foot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
jelly, but tasted much better. It
shook upon its platter like the showpiece
in any caterer's window.</p>

<p>He had cored large apples, and,
with a concoction of beaten eggs,
molasses, nuts and a bit of mint to
flavor it, filled the gaps and baked
them. The apples were soft and
shiny when they came forth from the
oven, and immediately, Cookee
poured some melted sugar over them
and allowed them to crystallize in
the cold.</p>

<p>Several other unique side dishes
had been made by the ingenious
cook, and the ladies were most generous
in their praise.</p>

<p>For several nights preceding
Christmas Eve, the children had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
been sent to bed as soon as supper
was over, to give the elders plenty
of time to string pop-corn, make paper
trimmings, and arrange generally
for the great tree they were to
have in the clearing if the day was
fair, or in the dining-room if it
stormed.</p>

<p>Christmas Eve was very clear and
not too cold to be enjoyable out of
doors. So, the men planted the tree
in the middle of the clearing in the
morning, and the children wandered
about it all that day, trying to figure
out how it ever would get trimmed.</p>

<p>"Tause," said Babs to Dot, "Dere
ain't any chimbley fer Santy to come
down!"</p>

<p>"But, we are almos' up in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
home an' mebbe he don't use chimbleys
at the North Pole," ventured
Dot, who was somewhat suspicious
of fat old Santa ever creeping down
their chimneys at Oakwood.</p>

<p>That afternoon, Mike was told
that the driver of one of the sledges
would be free to take the children
on a sleigh-ride party to the place
where he knew the holly and mistletoe
grew. The children were eager
to go, and soon were out of the way.</p>

<p>The moment the coast was clear
the elders hurried out of the cabins
with huge bundles of trimmings for
the tree and started to dress it up in
all manner of finery. Long chains
of white and colored pop-corn, fancy
cut and fluted tissue-paper chains,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
paper flowers, rosy apples, numerous
paper bundles that meant gifts for
everyone, tinsel threads everywhere
from tip to tip of the branches, and
last of all large candles that would
not blow out in a light breeze and
would burn a long time.</p>

<p>Huge pine torches were stuck in
safe places all about the clearing,
and the large lanterns that hung on
poles were ready for the illumination.</p>

<p>The timber men came in early that
day, for they knew of Santa Claus'
visit early that night, and washed
and dressed for the occasion.</p>

<p>The sledge with the children returned
about four o'clock laden with vines
and berries for trimming the
dining-room.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>The moment the children came
toward the clearing, however, they
gave shrieks of pleasure. Everyone
ran out to see the cause of the joy
and everyone was surprised (?) to
find the tree all ready for lighting.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mumzie, I thought Santa
never came until night!" cried Dot,
disappointed to find that her plot to
catch him had failed.</p>

<p>"That is the way down home, of
course; but here, why I suppose this
will be his first stop as we are so
near his home," replied Mrs. Starr.</p>

<p>Babs <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'stoods'">stood</ins> gaping at the tree and
never saying a word.</p>

<p>"Say, Mumzie, you jus' said
'Would be his first stop' but he's
been and done it!" exclaimed Don.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, but he hasn't distributed the
gifts. Don't you think he will want
to hand them about himself?" asked
Mrs. Starr.</p>

<p>"Maybe he won't have time, you
know. He has to go so far to-night.
Maybe that's why he hung them
here so early&mdash;so's we could he'p
ourselves," ventured Dot, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Well, we will wait until dark
and see. If he hasn't returned by
five-thirty or six o'clock, I guess we
will do the giving," said Mrs. Starr,
leading Babs away to the cabin to
be dressed for Santa in case he
should come.</p>

<p>"I'm goin' to put on my best dress,
too, Mumzie," said Dot, and Don<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
whispered that he wanted to put on
his Sunday suit.</p>

<p>"All right, dearies, but hurry so
you will be here if he comes," returned
Mrs. Starr, smiling with anticipation.</p>

<p>Now, the postman who brought
mail and any shopping from the
town to the camp, every week, had
been engaged to keep up the delivery
all winter for very good pay, and
he willingly took the risk of getting
caught in a storm for the salary he
got. He had a brother who was the
very image of a Santa Claus&mdash;short,
fat, with white beard and ruddy
complexion; jolly as could be, too.
Mr. Starr talked with him while he
was in town and arranged for both<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
of the men to spend Christmas Day
at the camp where the jolly one was
to play Santa Claus for the children.</p>

<p>Mr. Starr had purchased material
for clothing and the ladies cut and
sewed them. The jolly man would
have to hide himself all evening, so
Babs and the twins would not see
him and thus find out the trick
played upon them. But, he could
reappear the next morning in costume
and remain so until time for
the brothers to return to town. This
would make the whole Christmas
Day one of bliss for the three little
ones&mdash;to think that Santa stayed
with them a whole day on the return
trip to the North Pole, after his
night's work was done!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>The children were dressed and
warmly wrapped up by the time a
horn was heard. Heads popped out
of cabin-doors, and everyone looked
in the direction of the tree. It was
wonderfully illuminated, every candle
flickering brightly in the dark.
All about the clearing the great pine
knots flared and the lanterns burned
steadily, making the entire place a
glow of light.</p>

<p>"Oh, Dot, run, run!" called Don,
dragging his sister out by the hand.</p>

<p>"O-oh! isn't it grand!" sighed
Dot, standing with clasped hands.</p>

<p>The others came out of their cabins
and hurried over to the tree.</p>

<p>"Santa's come again and lit de
lights!" cried Babs, ecstatically.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did he, Daddum?" asked Don,
doubting that Santa did the lighting.</p>

<p>"I didn't do it, and I don't believe
anyone of the men did it&mdash;did you?"
asked Mr. Starr, turning to the
group of smiling men.</p>

<p>"I didn't, and I know not one of
the timber-jacks did it," said Mr.
Latimer, soberly.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Babs, who was seeking
under a branch for a tempting ball
of pop-corn that hung low, gave a
shriek of mingled fear and joy.</p>

<p>"Oh, he's here! He's sleeping in
here!" cried she, pointing her chubby
fingers toward the tree.</p>

<p>"Who? What?" demanded the
twins, running over to Babs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>Meredith and Paul hurried over
also and stood surprised to see real
Santa Claus come out from under
the branches, rubbing his eyes and
yawning.</p>

<p>"Well, well, well, friends! I
must have taken a nap! I am so
tired from working nights over all
the dolls and toys! But, now I will
soon have to go!" chuckled the jolly
old fellow.</p>

<p>Babs stood as still as could be, but
Don and Dot danced a frenzied
dance and shouted with joy to find
dear old Santa really there with
them.</p>

<p>"Oh, Santa, we are <i>so</i> glad to see
you," they cried, while everyone
smiled and repeated the welcome.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>"And I'm glad to be with you. I
made up my mind that I would try
to stop early on my way to the
other children. Now, if you want
me to give you these gifts, I'd better
be busy for I have a long way to
travel to-night, you know. But I
may stop over in the morning and
see how you like your presents."</p>

<p>This was too much for the twins'
cup of happiness, and they ran up
and clung to their beloved friend.</p>

<p>The distribution of gifts then
took place and everyone from Mike
to Mr. Latimer was remembered.</p>

<p>The children knew there was no
place toys could be had in that faraway
forest, so of course Santa Claus
had brought them when he came!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>The revelation that there was a
really and truly Santa Claus gave
Dot and Don more happiness than
anything else, for, at home, some of
the boys and girls said it was all
make-believe.</p>

<p>While everyone sat in the dining-room
eating supper, and talking
their heads almost off about the tree
and the fun, Santa went away, for
he was nowhere to be found when
the children ran out again toward
the tree.</p>

<p>During the singing of carols, and
the story of the Star of Bethlehem,
Don and Dot often turned their
heads to listen, but no jingle of bells
could they hear, so he <i>must</i> have
gone on his route.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>The children slept like tops that
night, but early in the morning when
they came out for breakfast, there
sat Santa, under the tree, as happy
and fresh as could be, after his long
night's work.</p>

<p>All that day was one long uninterrupted
dream that had come true.
Santa played all kinds of games
with the children and seemed to
have the time of his life. Then,
toward dusk, he shook hands with
everyone in camp and said he had
to start for the North Pole.</p>

<p>"Come again, Santa!" called
Babs, as she waved her hand at the
old fellow.</p>

<p>"I'll try to, Baby," said Santa
Claus as he went toward the stable.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>"Gee, Dot, we never thought to
peep in the stable and see his reindeers
and sleigh," whispered Don.</p>

<p>Mrs. Starr suspected what Don
had said, however, and replied, "No,
of course not! Do you suppose we
want Santa to think we are such ill-bred
people as to be curious? Let
the dear old man depart in peace."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>MIKE'S BEAR TRAP</h3>


<div class='cap'>WORK and play went quickly
after the holidays and February
soon arrived with the timber-men
working harder than ever to get
out all the logs possible before the
thaw set in. Just as soon as the thaw
sets in in the northern woods, the
roads become almost impassable and
ice starts to break up. The river
overflows its banks and carries
everything before it.</div>

<p>The river that was expected to
flood and carry down the logs of the
Manitoba Lumber Company generally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
drove them into a large lagoon
where the saw-mills belonging to
the company stood.</p>

<p>February was a short month, but
the weather held good so that the
men got out more timber that month
than in January. The banks of the
river were completely hidden under
immense roll-ways of pine logs, so
arranged that the moment the water
rose the logs lying in the edge of
the water would float out and that
would gradually roll the entire mass
of lumber into the water.</p>

<p>The first few days in March were
very warm, and cracklings of ice
could be heard distinctly through
the woods. The men feared that
work for the season was over, for,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
with the thaw, the work of hauling
timber would have to cease. Still,
they hoped that a period of cold
would come on top of the thaw and
that would just about permit them
to finish the area of forest timber
that had been mapped out in the
Fall.</p>

<p>Mike had decided to abandon his
trip to the North Woods for hunting
and trapping, for he figured out that
he could make more money by accepting
the bosses' offer. This
money was clear profit and he could
put it in the bank at Winnipeg to
await his old age when he could
work no more.</p>

<p>But Mike set traps and did some
hunting about the woods and kept<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
the camp supplied with game and
venison. He had one large trap set
several miles from camp, but as yet
had not caught anything in it.</p>

<p>The day before the warm spell set
in, Mike sniffed the air and took note
of various signs in the woods that
told him a thaw was on the road.
Consequently he knew that, if it was
of a long enough period of time,
many of the animals that sleep during
the winter months would be
tempted to come out and look about.</p>

<p>Finding nothing to eat, they
would be led to seek farther afield,
for they would be hungry after a
long sleep.</p>

<p>Mike loped over to his traps that
afternoon, and, having found the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
large one in good order, he baited it
and arranged it so deftly that not
one bit of the iron showed through
the twigs and leaves.</p>

<p>As he expected, the thaw began
that night and the temperature became
higher each day until the trees
seemed about to burst into blossom.</p>

<p>Mike didn't visit the trap the first
day of the thaw, but on the afternoon
of the second day he hurried
out to cross the forest in the direction
of his traps. Halfway there,
he stopped and looked at some
tracks in the soft slushy snow.</p>

<p>"Ha! Mike in time for him.
Him big bear. Him hungry an'
come see camp, but smell meat in
trap&mdash;ha!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>Mike followed the tracks eagerly
and found they led him almost directly
to the place where his long-waited-for
prize was caught.</p>

<p>The bear was exhausted from
struggling to escape from the trap
and Mike soon put an end to her
pain with a rifle-bullet.</p>

<p>She was an immense black bear
which must have come some distance
for food. Mike looked her over
carefully and nodded his head with
understanding as he spoke to himself
while loosing the spring on the
trap.</p>

<p>"Her got cubs at home in her cave.
Her hungly an' hunt eats for her
babbies. Mike mus' hunt for babbies
an' carry home to feed."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>The trap was set again, and with
satisfaction that his whole winter
was not wasted in a civilized life&mdash;proof&mdash;the
bear he was dragging
back to camp&mdash;Mike appeared at
the clearing just as the children wondered
what had become of their play-mate.</p>

<p>Mike dragged the improvised carrier
made of boughs, with the black
bear laid out upon them, into the
camp where everyone gathered to
behold the trophy of the Indian's
trap. They felt of the thick fur, the
still warm nose, and examined the
sharp claws that could be so cruel.</p>

<p>"My, but she's a big one, Mike!"
said Mr. Latimer.</p>

<p>"Humph! Her got two cubs&mdash;home.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
Mike mus' go fin' 'em now.
Babbies hungly an' got no eats.
Babbies starve."</p>

<p>The bear was taken to a place under
the trees back of the Cookee's
cabin, and Mike filled his belt with
ammunition and saw to it that his
rifle was in perfect order, for he
might meet with opposition from
some hungry animals on his way to
find the cave.</p>

<p>Cookee packed a good kit of food
for Mike, and, strapping this, with
a blanket, upon his back, he started
off on his quest. The children stood
mournfully watching him disappear
through the thick forest, then turned
their attention to planning what to
do with the little bears.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wish I could have gone with
him," said Paul.</p>

<p>"Me too! What's the use of
spending a winter in Canada if you
have to snoop around camp all the
time," added Meredith.</p>

<p>Mike found the tracks of the bear
where he had first seen them, and
followed them closely.</p>

<p>That night, Mike made camp out
in the open forest, and heard enough
beasts prowling about his fire during
the night to prove that they had not
all been frightened away.</p>

<p>Early in the morning, after a
hasty breakfast, Mike picked up the
tracks again and kept on going until
the steep cliffs of the mountain were
reached. Here he became very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
watchful, for at any moment a panther
or bear might pounce upon him.</p>

<p>Mike was prepared to battle with
the mate of the old she-bear if necessary,
but he thought it likely that
the bear had followed his mate, in
search of food for the cubs. If he
had, he would most likely get
caught in the trap also. If he was
about the cave, Mike would have
his hands full in smoking him out,
or in watching for him and shooting
him when he found him.</p>

<p>The trapper surely was favored
that day, for he soon found the trail
that led to a large cave in the side
of the cliffs, and after careful investigation,
found that tracks of both
bears led down the mountain side,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
but that none returned. He lit
a torch of resinous wood and crept
carefully toward the cave.</p>

<p>He looked all about and laid his
ear to the ground to ascertain if anything
were approaching. Finding
all quiet, except a faint rustle of
leaves in the cave, Mike poked the
long pole, with the torch at the end,
ahead of him into the cave.</p>

<p>After following the winding tunnel
for some yards, he suddenly
came out into an open space about
seven feet wide, and five feet high
in the middle. He had to stoop to
get in and, when his eyes grew accustomed
to the circle of light
thrown upon the walls of the cave,
he saw two fat little cubs curled up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
in a bed of dried leaves and twigs.
He planted the torch against the
wall and turning over one little cub
he found they were both fast asleep&mdash;probably
had not yet opened their
eyes since they were born. As Mike
had to bring both away to keep them
from starving, he slung his rifle over
his back and took a little cub under
each arm. He started out of the
cave very carefully, on guard
against the old fellow who might
come in at any time. But there was
no obstacle to his getting down the
side of the mountain quickly and
along the trail by which he came.</p>

<p>The little cubs shivered slightly
and curled up closer to Mike's side,
and he chuckled over them as he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
thought of the surprise they would
receive at camp.</p>

<p>Mike avoided the trail after he
reached familiar woods and struck
off across the forest for camp. His
gun had to be slung upright at his
back to permit his passage between
trees, but he soon came out upon the
road-cut and then it was easy walking
The fat little cubs felt heavy
before Mike reached camp and Mike
was only too thankful to deposit
them in his bunk at the little cabin
which he called his own.</p>

<p>He tried to waken the furry balls
by pulling their ears and rolling
them over and over, but they snoozed
on as peacefully as if cuddled by
their old mother's paws.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>Mike had been gone from camp
two days, and the children were not
yet aware of his presence, but
Cookee saw him lope across the clearing
and enter his cabin.</p>

<p>"Cookee, give us some crackers?"
asked Don, as Dot and he rushed into
the kitchen after the cook.</p>

<p>"Crackers! what fer? to feed
Mike?" teased Cookee.</p>

<p>"Mike? No, for ourselves. Wish
Mike was back, though, 'cause Paul
said the other old bear might kill
him."</p>

<p>"Mike's back&mdash;I saw him go in his
cabin a few minutes ago," said
Cookee, turning to take some crackers
from a jar.</p>

<p>He turned again to hand them to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
the twins but laughed when he
found them gone&mdash;running for all
they were worth to Mike's cabin.</p>

<p>"Funny lil' critters! An' don'
they just love Mike!" said the cook
to himself, as he started to roll out
the biscuit dough.</p>

<p>"Hello, Mike! when did you get
back?" cried both Don and Dot as
they rushed into the cabin.</p>

<p>Without waiting for an answer,
both children saw the two furry balls
on the bunk and stepped softly
over, to see what they were.</p>

<p>"Oh, the cuties! what are they,
Mike?" cried Dot.</p>

<p>"Cubs; old bear's babbies!" said
Mike, smiling at the twins as they
hugged and cuddled the cubs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Mike! <i>they</i> will never grow
up to hurt anyone, will they?" asked
Dot, doubtfully.</p>

<p>"No siree! 'cause we are goin' to
keep 'em and train 'em to be as good
as a Newfoundland dog," said Don.</p>

<p>"But they are Mike's bears," said
Dot.</p>

<p>"But Mike will give 'em to us, if
we love 'em," replied Don.</p>

<p>"Dat's what dey for!" said Mike.</p>

<p>"Oh, oh! Look Mike, see this
little one stick out his tiny pink
tongue," shouted Dot, excitedly.</p>

<p>"Him hungly!    Mike git dinner!"</p>

<p>So, leaving Don and Dot to watch
the cubs, Mike went to the cook's
cabin and hunted for a bottle with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
slender neck. With a red-hot wire
he bored a small hole through a
cork and, after filling the bottle with
diluted condensed milk and oatmeal
gruel, he drove the cork into the
neck. He wrapped the bottle inside
his coat and hurried over to the cabin
with it.</p>

<p>The ladies and the other children
had been called to the exhibition by
Don, after Mike went to the kitchen,
and all of them were delighted
over the dear little fur-balls. Lavinia
held one of the soft, velvety
paws in her hands smiling at the
tiny toes and pink skin underneath.
Suddenly, however, the cub
stretched and from the velvet paw
there shot out five sharp nails, long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
enough to make the children gasp.</p>

<p>"Where does he hide them?" said
Lavinia.</p>

<p>"Gee! I never thought bear babies
had claws like that!" said Don,
showing more respect for the cubs
thereafter.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mike, what are you going to
do?" asked everyone who had seen
the bottle.</p>

<p>"Feed babbies," grinned Mike, as
he opened a cub's mouth and stuck
the bottle inside at an angle that
would let the liquid run out&mdash;and in.</p>

<p>Immediately, the cub gulped and
started sucking at the impromptu
feeding bottle.</p>

<p>Mike watched the milk diminish
and when the bottle was half empty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
he took it away and opened the other
little cub's mouth for its food. The
first one, being comfortably fed,
rolled over and went on sleeping.</p>

<p>The second cub was the smaller
of the two and could not drink the
milk as rapidly as the sturdier one.
Several times it choked and had to
cough and sneeze, which made the
children laugh delightedly, but
Mike waited patiently until it had
recovered breath.</p>

<p>"Mike, won't they wake up and
play?" asked Dot.</p>

<p>"Him wake up, tree-four-five
day!" replied Mike.</p>

<p>"Not before?" asked Don.</p>

<p>"Not before him eye open&mdash;'bout
five day!" returned Mike.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>Mike made a bed of balsam tips
covered with an old buck-skin shirt.</p>

<p>The cubs were deposited upon the
new bed and curled up close together,
never missing their old home or
realizing that they had a foster-mother.
Mike fed them regularly,
and the children found them a never-ending
source of delight.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>FATHER BEAR VISITS THE CAMP</h3>


<div class='cap'>THE following morning after
his return from the cave,
Mike started off to inspect his traps.
He rather suspected that the old
father bear had deserted the mother
and cubs and wandered over the
mountain in another direction and
possibly been trapped by some hunter.
If such was not the case, he
might have come upon his mate's
tracks and followed her to the trap.
In that case he might have been
trapped as his mate was.   There was
still another thought which came to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
Mike, but he disliked dwelling on
it: the bear might scent the man who
stole the babies and follow him.
Mike knew of cases where a mother
bear had followed her cubs for miles
and miles and then fought with the
thief.</div>

<p>Therefore, Mike was very observing
as he crept through the
woods and started through the glade
where the trap was set. He saw
tracks, which had been recently
made, all over the soft top ground,
for the thaw had melted the snow
that bore the she-bear's tracks and
soaked the ground enough to soften
it for half an inch into the frost; here
were plainly seen the marks of great
paws as they trampled the area<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
about the trap, but never came near
enough to be caught.</p>

<p>But there was no sign of a bear
about. Looking very carefully
from right to left, Mike started back
to camp, prepared at the first sound
or sign to shoot.</p>

<p>Mike had almost reached the
camp when he heard shouts and
cries of terror. He ran as fast as
he could, and found the women and
Babs in the dining-room with doors
closed, shouting directions from a
partially opened window. Cookee
was at the window of his kitchen
waving a pail of boiling water
about. The older children were
shut in the office with faces pressed
close against the panes of glass, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
Don and Dot were in his own cabin
which had but one small pane of
glass let in the front of the door.
The door was closed, but a ponderous
shaggy bear stood snuffling at
the crack at the bottom, and uttering,
ever and again, the most terrifying
growls.</p>

<p>The people had sought safety
wherever they had been caught at
the time the bear marched into the
clearing, after following the scent
of his dead mate's body. With nose
to the ground he must have been on
his way toward the little shed where
the she-bear hung, when a new scent
greeted his nose. He made for
Mike's cabin and began to realize
that his children were in there.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>Immediately he tore at the wood
and demanded in stern tones to be
admitted.</p>

<p>Don and Dot, looking at each
other in dismay, peeped out of the
window to behold that most appalling
hulk standing at the door!</p>

<p>Mike understood, but he must
plan to get a good sure shot at the
maddened bear without hitting the
glass in the door.</p>

<p>He crawled noiselessly across half
of the clearing to get an aim at the
bear from another vantage-point,
but the bear, in his intensity, was all
alert to sound, and heard the almost
imperceptible noise the Indian made
on the soft ground.</p>

<p>He turned, and stood glowering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
at his enemy who was about thirty
feet away. He seemed to know intuitively
that this was the man who
had ruined his home, and he stood
looking him over from head to foot.</p>

<p>Mike, very slowly, so as not to
cause the beast any action, brought
his rifle up to his shoulder, but before
he could take aim, the bear
sprang forward toward the man.</p>

<p>It took Mike but a moment to
dodge into the children's cabin and
shut the door. No, not quite!</p>

<p>The bear wheeled as soon as Mike
dodged, and came after him. The
time lost in turning the door-knob
and getting inside gave the bear time
to get to the door. The door was almost
closed upon the catch when the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
nose of the beast came plump up
against the wooden obstacle. The
door was pushed halfway open, but
Mike exerted all of his strength to
shove it back again, and dragged
the bureau up against it. Before he
could turn the lock to make the catch
hold better the bear threw his entire
weight up against the outside and
forced the door in again.</p>

<p>While he held his shoulder
against the door to keep the bear out,
he used his rifle to smash in the glass
of the little square window near the
door.</p>

<p>The moment this was done, Mike
jumped from his post behind the
door and managed to squeeze his
body through the window, while the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
bear, feeling resistance give way
from inside, forced himself in to devour
his enemy.</p>

<p>Mike got out and immediately
caught hold of the door from the outside
and banged it shut, caging the
bear in the little room.</p>

<p>The bear's face appeared at the
window whence his intended victim
had escaped, and he tried to get out.
He could barely push his large head
through but his shoulders stuck fast
in the opening.</p>

<p>Mike looked about for help and
found every window about the clearing
with a face pressed against it.
He yelled for the cook.</p>

<p>"Cookee! Him make Mike's lil'
gun ready!&mdash;in cabin!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>The cook, seeing that the wild
beast was safely shut up for the
time being, ran out of his kitchen
and hurried over to Mike's aid.
Mike made him understand that a
revolver was to be found in his cabin.
Cookee ran and loaded it, coming
back to Mike's side, just as the
bear, snarling and chewing at the
inner sill in his rage to get out,
poked his head through the opening.</p>

<p>"Cookee, hol' fas' door&mdash;Mike put
gun in him head!" said Mike, as he
motioned the cook to take his place
at the door.</p>

<p>At that moment, Don came out
and shouted to Mike.</p>

<p>"Hi, there, Mike! Let's leave
him in there and keep him caged up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
until we go home. Dot and I'll
sleep in the office if you'll let the
bear live there."</p>

<p>"Yes, Mike, please do," added
Dot.</p>

<p>"Whaf'fer?" asked Mike.</p>

<p>"To sell to the Central Park Menagerie!"
shouted Don.</p>

<p>"The big father bear and his two
children will be fine for everyone to
come and see, and Dot and I'll get
a heap of money fer 'em, and you can
have half," added Dot.</p>

<p>Just at that crisis, when the ladies
were going to call to Mike to shoot
the bear and be done with it, the
timber-men were heard coming from
the cutting.</p>

<p>Mr. Starr and Mr. Latimer came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
first, and, seeing that some unusual
event was going on, they ran over
to Mike to ask the cause. Just as
Mr. Latimer's eyes came opposite
the opening of the window, the bear
stuck his big bushy head out and,
with eyes like balls of fire, he uttered
a snarl that curled back his lips,
showing frightful fangs ready to
tear everyone to shreds.</p>

<p>Mr. Latimer made a queer noise,
halfway between a shriek and a
groan, and fell up against Cookee.
It was so unexpected and sudden
that Cookee was toppled off of his
feet and the door swung halfway
open again. In that second the bear
came down from the window and
thundered at the door, but Mike was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
too agile an Indian to have that door
open, and before the bear could get
his nose through the crack, the door
slammed shut again, and Mr. Starr
was stationed there to hold it.</p>

<p>"Meester Don an' Doot, say,
'Keep bear live for park,'" explained
Mike, waiting orders from
the bosses.</p>

<p>As soon as Cookee gained his
breath, which had been knocked out
by the sudden fall, he explained.</p>

<p>"The twins want to let the bear
stay in this cabin and they'll sleep
in the office. They want to sell him
to the park and get a lot of money."</p>

<p>"Shoot him, quick!" ordered Mr.
Starr, seeing the wet nose of the bear
appear at the opening again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>Mike took a good aim this time
and soon a crack of the gun, followed
by a heavy thud inside the
cabin, made them all breathe easier.
The doors of the other buildings
opened and the prisoners stepped
out to ask if it was safe to come over.</p>

<p>Don and Dot did not wait for an
answer but ran to join the men.</p>

<p>Mike carefully crept up to the
window and tried to see the inside
of the cabin, but he could only see
the two bunks opposite the window.
After a short time, not a sound being
heard inside, Mike pushed his
head inside the window.</p>

<p>There lay the ponderous animal
on the floor under the window just
as he had dropped.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>"All gone!" said Mike, laconically
as ever.</p>

<p>The door was opened and the men
peeped in first. Then the door was
opened wide and everyone went in.</p>

<p>"Two big dead bears, and two little
live ones," said Meredith.</p>

<p>"Not so bad for one trap's work,
eh?" said Paul.</p>

<p>"I was just thinking: what did
Mike want these for? Did we need
food, or fur, or was it just the natural
hunting spirit in most men that
made him do this," said Meredith.</p>

<p>"I feel that way, myself, Mete,"
added Lavinia. "And I am dreadfully
sorry for those dear little babies.
What will we ever do with
them?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm going to keep one," cried
Don.</p>

<p>"An' I've decided to keep the
other," added Dot.</p>

<p>"And remain in Canada after we
go home, eh?" laughed Mr. Starr.</p>

<p>"Why, no, we'll take them with
us," said Don.</p>

<p>"Not with my consent. Pay double
fares from Winnipeg to New York,
then have everything in Oakwood
torn to pieces, including the
family, when the bears grow larger."</p>

<p>"Oh, we'll only keep them while
they are cute like puppy dogs, then
we'll send them to the menagerie,"
replied Don.</p>

<p>"Better turn them loose in the
woods," said Cookee.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, no, now that we have had
all the trouble of getting them, and
they are orphans, they will never
know any other home than a cage, so
I agree with the children&mdash;let us
keep them while we remain and they
will play like puppies, then ship
them to the city to be trained," said
Mrs. Starr.</p>

<p>As her word was generally
obeyed, the matter was considered
settled, and the cubs remained where
they were for a time.</p>

<p>In a few days, the cubs opened
their tiny twinkling eyes, and soon
were able to roll around. At first
they tried to stand, but their fat little
legs would not hold them up,
and they rolled on the floor like balls<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
of fur. Many a shout of glee rang
out from the dining-room when the
cubs tried to exercise. But in a
week's time they could jump and
run after the twins if they teased
them.</p>

<p>A long, hard spell of cold weather
followed the bear-fight, and the children
had to play indoors every afternoon
for some time, but they preferred
it on account of their new
play-fellows.</p>

<p>The little bears grew strong and
mischievous, and many a bout they
had with Don and Dot, the latter
generally having to climb upon the
table to get away from them.</p>

<p>Mike took especial pride in keeping
them clean and chubby, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
two bears followed him as if he was
a natural protector. He never
teased them and said little, but they
knew that he was their foster-mother.</p>

<p>The first week in March, the cold
broke up and the thaw began slowly
but surely to melt away the deep
snows which fell in February, and
ice started to soften and crack.</p>

<p>The men realized that most of
their season's work was completed
and were happy to find that they had
cut several thousand feet more than
the figure given them. As they still
had several days in which they might
work, it would figure up to nearly
50,000 extra feet of timber ready to
market.</p>

<p>One morning, Mr. Starr stood<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
talking to his wife, when the children
came across the opening toward
the school-room. Close upon the
twins' heels came the two cubs,
stopping now and then to sniff at
something on the ground, then trying
to run and catch up but falling
over each other in the attempt.</p>

<p>As the group came up to Mr. and
Mrs. Starr, the former said, "Well,
children, our winter in the forest is
almost over. Mumzie and I were
just talking about packing up for
home."</p>

<p>"Home!" said Don, aghast.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" added Dot.</p>

<p>"Yes, home," repeated Mr. Starr.
"The rivermen will soon start the
logs down stream and there is nothing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
further to keep us here, but I
am needed at the other end."</p>

<p>"Oh, I was hoping we might live
here until summer," said Lavinia,
regretfully.</p>

<p>"You are not homesick, then,"
smiled Mrs. Starr.</p>

<p>"Homesick! I should say not!"
declared the children.</p>

<p>"Well, to tell the truth, children,
I've had a most unusual winter of
enjoyment, but I shall be heartily
glad to see my beautiful home
again," said Mrs. Starr.</p>

<p>"So shall I," added Mrs. Latimer.
"Camp life is fine for a few months,
but I have had enough to last me a
long time. I want a porcelain bathtub
and electric lights for a change."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>Everyone laughed, and the children
went on to school, but the suggestion
made them all feel a bit
homesick, though reluctant to leave
the grand old forests.</p>

<p>A few days later, Mrs. Starr and
Mrs. Latimer began to pack their
various belongings, to have things
in readiness to leave when the time
came.</p>

<p>Cookee also began packing the
travelling outfit, for he would accompany
the men on the trip down
the river. They would make a camp
at a place for a night or two, and
then move on, as the large drift of
logs permitted.</p>

<p>A large case had been ordered
from the town for the cubs, and it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
was decided to put them in, nail
slats across the top and ship them
directly to the park commissioner at
Central Park, for the menagerie
there.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>AFLOAT ON THE RIVER RAFT</h3>


<div class='cap'>AS the milder weather settled
down to stay, Don began
thinking of the river and the fun
of watching the piled up logs gradually
sink down into the water, so
he spoke to Dot about it.</div>

<p>"Let's go down to the river on
Saturday morning and play," suggested
he.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's awful far, Don, an' we
won't get back to dinner," objected
Dot.</p>

<p>"We'll get Cookee to give us
something to eat and we can walk<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
slowly so you won't get tired. The
roads are all cut out now, and there
is no snow," persisted Don.</p>

<p>"All right. I'll go. Goin' to
bring the others?"</p>

<p>"'Course not!" retorted Don.</p>

<p>Saturday morning was warm and
clear and Don ran into Cookee's
kitchen after breakfast with a request
for some lunch as Dot and he
were going to have some fun. Cook
willingly gave lunch&mdash;glad to have
the twins out of the way for the
morning while the baking was done.</p>

<p>Don and Dot hurried off without
being seen by anyone. Mike had
kept an eye on them since their escapade
of the Jumpin' Jane, but he
was busy showing Babs the bear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
cub's sharp white teeth and warning
the baby about playing with them
when no one else was about.</p>

<p>The timber-jacks were cutting
way back beyond the road that ran
past the clearing, and the twins had
every opportunity to get down to
the river without being seen. Even
the road that had been cut from the
forest to the river was now abandoned
by the teamsters, for they had
cut a new road some miles the other
side of the old one and had it paved
with logs to keep the wheels of the
low truck from sinking into the soft
thawing earth.</p>

<p>It took the twins some hours to
gain the river-side, for the walking
was troublesome. In some places<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
where the ice and snow still clung to
the exposed knolls, it was slippery,
but in others, where the thaw had
melted the frost and poured its waters
into the glades, they had to skirt
the pools or go through them. Consequently,
by the time they reached
the river, they were tired and wet to
the knees.</p>

<p>"Ah! here we are at last!" cried
Dot, as she sat down to rest.</p>

<p>"Come up on this tall heap of
logs," said Don, scrambling up to
the top of a twenty foot pier.</p>

<p>The children sat there looking all
about the country with delight.
The air was warm enough to be comfortable,
and the river looked wonderful
with the swift current pouring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
down the center and huge blocks
of ice floating up against the banks
or being whirled into the stream by
suction of the current.</p>

<p>"Great, isn't it!" exclaimed Don.</p>

<p>"Yes, but I wouldn't want to be
on one of those cakes of ice," shivered
Dot.</p>

<p>"Neither would anyone!"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I would like to
play," said Dot.</p>

<p>"What?" asked Don.</p>

<p>"I'd play I was one of the river-men
with a peavie an' I'd try to
push the logs down in the river,"
said Dot, looking down at some
logs lying halfway in the water.</p>

<p>"How could we manage&mdash;let me
see!   We could get out on that raft<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
and stand on that to push the logs
out," suggested Don.</p>

<p>"Sure! We'll pull the raft up to
the bank by the chains, an' then push
her out again with our peavies."</p>

<p>So the two scrambled down from
the logs and hunted about for two
long sticks that would answer for
the peavies the timber-jacks used.
After finding two desirable poles,
the twins ran down to the river to
pull in the raft.</p>

<p>This was not quite so easy as it
would seem, for the logs were water-soaked
after a long winter in the
water, but after a long tiresome haul
they brought the raft near enough to
board it by climbing out over a huge
cake of ice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>"But we can't reach the logs from
here!" cried Dot, finding that they
were on the other side of the ice-cake.</p>

<p>"We'll have to shove that iceberg
out into the river," said Don, looking
about for the best channel to
work through.</p>

<p>"Let's push our raft up behind it
and then we can push the ice easier,"
advised Dot.</p>

<p>This was sensible, so both children
pushed their peavies into some
smaller ice floes and managed to
move the ponderous raft into a position
so the large ice-floe could be
moved. The ice was thick and the
weight of it made it sink down low
in the water, but after many breathless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
efforts it was moved out of the
way far enough to permit the twins
to work the raft in closer to shore.
Here they met with a new difficulty,
for the logs were still clinging to
the ground with frost and were not
to be coaxed into the water.</p>

<p>"If we only had cant-hooks so we
could yank them in!" sighed Dot.</p>

<p>"Guess I'll have to jump ashore
and try to tip one of those top logs
down," said Don, looking up at the
pile they had sat upon.</p>

<p>"Pooh! you can't budge them a
mite! It takes two men with hooks
to pull them out," said Dot.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Don made up his
mind to get <i>one</i> log in the river at
any cost. He couldn't stand the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
thought of being defeated by an inanimate
log.</p>

<p>He found that, the large ice-floe
being out of the pathway to shore, he
would have to jump from one small
cake to another and follow the bank
of the river until he reached a small
land-jetty about fifty feet down
stream.</p>

<p>This he did while Dot watched
him breathlessly, expecting every
moment to see the ice sink and slide
him into the stream.</p>

<p>Don reached the bank in safety
and then ran back toward the place
where the raft was anchored. Before
he reached the place, however,
he stopped and looked with interest
at some attraction on the bank. Dot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
saw him stop but could not see what
it was as the logs all along the edge
of the river hid the object from view.</p>

<p>After a few minutes, he ran on to
the narrow landing where they had
boarded the raft.</p>

<p>"Say, Dot, there are lots of logs
lying almost in the water down there
by that crooked tree. If we could
move that raft down there we could
have lots of fun floating them out to
the current," said Don.</p>

<p>"That's easy to say&mdash;move the
raft! How can you move anything
that's chained as this is?" asked
Dot, disgustedly.</p>

<p>"I don't know! Let me think!"</p>

<p>Don crawled in under the tier of
logs to the place down at the edge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
of the river where the chain of the
raft ran ashore. He pulled the chain
up as it lay slack in the water and
found that the loop on shore was
thrown about a low stump of pine
that was left sticking out of the
bank, almost hidden by the high
pile of logs over it.</p>

<p>"Ha! if I can haul the raft in a
few feet, while you push with your
stick, I can lift this chain off of the
stump," called Don, showing Dot
how the raft was fastened.</p>

<p>Dot began pushing and Don
pulled until the heavy raft floated
in shore far enough for Don to drag
the chain off the stump.</p>

<p>The raft, released from its moorings,
moved slightly out toward the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
former position, the chain slipping
into the water and dragging behind.</p>

<p>Don was satisfied with the result
of his idea and ran down to the spot
where the logs could be readily
edged into the water if the small ice
floes were out of the way. He
pushed and worked at the ice until a
clear pathway of water lay before
the logs. Those in the edge of the
water, were easily shoved out, but
the others were too heavy to budge.</p>

<p>"Hi, there! Dot, shall I bring out
the lunch for the raft?" called Don,
as he bethought him of going back
to Dot.</p>

<p>"Yes, an' hurry up, 'cause I think
this raft is movin' some toward the
river!" replied Dot, anxiously.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, naw, she ain't! She's only
swirling about a bit in the motion
of the water!" said Don.</p>

<p>He ran and got the lunch and then
tried to jump from one cake of ice to
another just as he did when he went
ashore. But he found that going
ashore against the current was much
easier than going out with the current,
for every cake of ice he jumped
upon shot out from under his feet
with the river current.</p>

<p>As he was halfway over, he had to
continue or leave Dot alone on the
raft. That was entirely out of his
plans, so he used his pole to push
himself over as near to the large ice-floe
as possible. The cake of ice he
was on was small enough to be submerged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
every time Don pushed his
pole against anything, and by the
time he was able to jump on the
large ice-floe his feet and legs were
soaking wet again. Once up on the
large floe, Don felt relieved for a
fear had assailed him when he found
he couldn't jump the small cakes.</p>

<p>"Push the raft over to me&mdash;I can't
make this floe budge!" called Don.</p>

<p>So Dot shoved the pole against a
mass of ice and moved the raft over
toward Don's floe. As soon as he
could jump, he came on the raft and
the two felt better for being together.</p>

<p>"I'm hungry, aren't you?" said
Don, taking the lunch from his pockets.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; let's have lunch now, and
play river-men after," returned Dot.</p>

<p>As they sat munching the lunch
the motion of the wavelets under the
raft, dancing it up and down, made
them laugh.</p>

<p>The ice-floe stuck close to them after
Don jumped from it, and they
never noticed that the floe and raft
were slowly floating out from shore.</p>

<p>A sudden jar of the raft against
another huge ice-floe that came down
stream made them take notice of
their greater distance from shore.</p>

<p>"Gee! Dot, we have floated out
more'n ten feet from the bank!"
said Don, looking about doubtfully.</p>

<p>"So we have! We'd better pole
back again," said Dot.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>Without another word, both <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'childred'">children</ins>
tried to pole back, but they
were working against the current
that had begun to take hold of the
ice-floe and raft.</p>

<p>The ice-floe was so deep down in
the water that the current that ran
underneath drew it along. But the
raft being on the surface was not so
easily carried. Don thought for a
few seconds.</p>

<p>"Dot, if we try to push that floe
off we won't be dragged along with
it. She's doin' all the mischief!"</p>

<p>So both children turned their effort
to shoving off the ice-floe and
soon succeeded in moving it beyond
the reach of the poles. As they
watched it being caught gradually<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
by the river current, Don whispered
to his sister.</p>

<p>"Now, let's get back as quickly as
we can!"</p>

<p>But the poles were too short now
to touch bottom, and there were no
ice cakes about to offer the necessary
resistance.</p>

<p>"What now?" asked Dot, looking
at Don with full understanding of
their dangerous position.</p>

<p>"What would you advise?" said
Don, looking at the dark water.</p>

<p>"Can we swim ashore?" asked
Dot.</p>

<p>"Nope! not in this current. Besides
the water's as cold as ice, you
know. We'd have cramps in a minute."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>Silence for some time, while each
one thought of some way to escape
from the raft.</p>

<p>"I know! Pull up the chain from
the water and let's sling it over
something on shore as soon as we
float opposite!"</p>

<p>"Ain't that just like a girl! Why,
Dot, I thought that bein' my twin
you'd have more sense than that!"
replied Don, disdainfully.</p>

<p>True to her feminine nature, however,
Dot lay down flat upon the
raft and hauled in the chain with the
loop at the end.</p>

<p>"You can't fling it 'cause it's too
heavy, and the raft will float out
further all the time&mdash;not toward
shore!" objected Don, as he watched.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>Dot was still down on the raft but
Don was standing up when, suddenly,
an immense ice-floe coming down
stream struck another one and shot
out toward shore striking the corner
of the raft such a blow that Don
measured his full length out on the
logs. The raft was partially submerged
but was shoved out of the
way of the floe, and left within a few
feet of the bank.</p>

<p>"Hurrah! Now we can pole
back!" yelled Don, scrambling to his
feet to snatch his pole. He looked
about but the pole had been washed
off when the corner of the raft went
under water.</p>

<p>"Hi, there, Dot, gim'me yours&mdash;quick!"
cried Don, as he saw the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
raft slowly turn about and go out
into the current again.</p>

<p>Dot rolled off of her pole, upon
which she had been lying, thereby
saving it from the water.</p>

<p>Don pushed and pushed for all he
was worth and managed to propel
the clumsy raft further toward
shore. Every foot made it easier, for
the water was shallower and the current
less. Within a few feet of
shore, Dot flung her chain out,
bound to have her way about a rescue.
As the chain shot out, Dot
slipped on the wet logs, and fell into
the water.</p>

<p>Don was stupefied for a moment,
but Dot had great presence of mind
and was going to swim when she felt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
a solid foundation two feet under
water. She managed to stand up
and called to Don:</p>

<p>"See, I'm standing on something
hard. Guess it's logs!"</p>

<p>As it was on one side of the raft,
Dot held on to the edge of the raft
and felt her way along the hard logs
under water until she reached the
extreme end of the raft. Here she
let go and slowly shoved her foot
ahead of her until she felt the water
getting shallower as she proceeded
toward shore. She was now but five
feet from the bank where a huge
pine log had fallen end-wise into
the river. She climbed up and held
on to the rough bark, scrambling,
hand over hand, along the trunk until<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
she reached the towering pile
from which the pine had rolled.</p>

<p>Don saw the way to go ashore,
and immediately sat down on the
edge of the raft and slid off into the
water just where Dot had held on to
the corner of the raft. He also felt
the hard logs underneath and crept
along until he reached the pine-tree.</p>

<p>As soon as he was up beside his
sister, they looked at each other and
heaved a mighty sigh.</p>

<p>"The raft's skidding," said Dot,
pointing out to the water.</p>

<p>Don looked; sure enough, the
raft must have been caught in a
side current and sent down stream.</p>

<p>"That tumble of mine was the
best thing I did!" grinned Dot.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes! an' if you hadn't slung
that chain ashore you wouldn't have
tumbled into the water," admitted
Don.</p>

<p>"Say, Don, how do you s'pose
those logs are kept under water?"
asked Dot, wondering about her escape.</p>

<p>After a few moments silence, Dot
said, "Don, I guess I'm just a little
bit cold. These things won't dry
out here!"</p>

<p>"So'm I&mdash;let's go home!"</p>

<p>So the two trudged home, cold,
forlorn, and hungry.</p>

<p>"That's the first time I got left
when I made up my mind to do anything!"
grumbled Don, as the camp
was reached.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>"We didn't get left! the river
wanted to gobble us, and <i>it</i> got left&mdash;just
because I knew enough to
fling that chain!" said Dot; the latter
half of her sentence was given
with a grin at her brother.</p>

<p>"Mercy sakes alive! where <i>have</i>
you two been to get so wet!" cried
Mrs. Latimer, meeting the twins.</p>

<p>"We were playing and fell into
the water!" was all Don said, and no
one ever knew the narrow escape the
twins had from being whirled down
the dreadful river, and, perhaps,
drowned.</p>

<p>They were soon hustled into dry
clothing and made to drink hot lemonade
with plenty of ginger in it.</p>

<p>No unpleasant effects were felt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
from the drenching as every one of
the children were too hardy from
the outdoor life to take cold easily.</p>

<p>The very next day, Sunday, the
weather grew so warm that everything
was dripping. The timber-men
found it impossible to cut more
that season and started to get ready
for the logging on the river. Cookee
was ready to move on with the men,
and the two families finished packing
and were ready to start back to
civilization early Tuesday morning.</p>

<p>The cubs were shipped off Monday
morning with the trunks.</p>

<p>Mike almost cried as he said good-bye
to the children, but he had had
a fine winter's income, and the sale
of the cubs would give him enough<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
money to keep him with care, in old
age.</p>

<p>As the carry-all, filled with children
and the ladies, started out of
camp, the timber-men waved their
hats and yelled after the disappearing
vehicle, making the children feel
that they were leaving good friends
behind.</p>

<p>So the Five Little Starrs left their
Winter Camp in the Canadian Forest
and went home. We next hear
of them in the book "Five Little
Starrs on a Motor Tour."</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
